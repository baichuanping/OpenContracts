## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Celery configured for at-least-once delivery so worker death no longer silently loses tasks** (Issue #1493, `config/settings/base.py:677`): `CELERY_TASK_ACKS_LATE = True` and `CELERY_TASK_REJECT_ON_WORKER_LOST = True` are now set globally. Previously Celery acked messages on receive (at-most-once): if a worker died mid-task — OOM, host failure, deploy, eviction, SIGKILL — the broker had already removed the message and the task was silently lost, leaving long-running ingest/parse/embed work with documents stuck at `backend_lock=True` and no parsed content. With the new settings the broker only acks after the task returns successfully, and hard-killed workers cause redelivery rather than silent disappearance. The redundant per-task `acks_late=True` on `opencontractserver/worker_uploads/tasks.py:76` is left in place as an explicit declaration of intent (it is now equivalent to the global default). Trade-off: at-least-once delivery means tasks may run twice, so all tasks must be idempotent — `docs/architecture/asynchronous-processing.md` documents the contract and the per-task opt-out (`@shared_task(acks_late=False, reject_on_worker_lost=False)`) for tasks that genuinely cannot be made idempotent. Regression test in `opencontractserver/tests/test_celery_worker_death_resilience.py` pins both settings and verifies the namespaced Django→Celery wiring still propagates them, so a future settings refactor cannot silently revert the resilience guarantee.

### Added

- **Loud guardrail against the `system_prompt=` foot-gun in pydantic-ai** (Issue #1451): `pydantic_ai.Agent` accepts both `system_prompt=` and `instructions=`, but the `system_prompt` value is *only* materialised into the model request when `message_history` is `None`. OpenContracts' `chat()` flow always persists the user's HUMAN message before calling `Agent.run()`, so `message_history` is never empty in practice and any `system_prompt=` argument is silently dropped — the LLM runs without any system instruction. CLAUDE.md pitfall #14 documented the workaround (use `instructions=`), but a future pydantic-ai bump that renames or re-precedences these parameters could re-introduce the regression silently.
  - **Single construction path** (`opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_factory.py`): new `make_pydantic_ai_agent(...)` factory is now the only place in the codebase that instantiates `pydantic_ai.Agent`. The factory uses a sentinel-based check (not `is not None`) to refuse `system_prompt=` outright — even `system_prompt=None` raises `TypeError` so the lesson cannot be re-learned by accident. The error message references issue #1451 and CLAUDE.md pitfall #14.
  - **All call sites refactored** (in `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`: `_run_structured_extraction`, the document-agent factory, and the corpus-agent factory; in `opencontractserver/tasks/memory_tasks.py`: `summarise_agent` and `curation_agent`). Five direct `PydanticAIAgent(...)` constructions in production code now route through the factory.
  - **Self-contained factory** (`opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_factory.py`): the factory imports `from pydantic_ai.agent import Agent as PydanticAIAgent` directly and calls `PydanticAIAgent(...)` with no sideways indirection through `pydantic_ai_agents`. Tests that need to intercept agent construction now patch `opencontractserver.llms.agents.pydantic_ai_factory.PydanticAIAgent` (44 patch sites updated across 7 test files: `test_pydantic_ai_agents.py`, `test_nested_approval_gates.py`, `test_agent_memory.py`, `test_duplicate_tool_registration.py`, `test_tool_approval_gate.py`, `test_long_conversation_api.py`). The chokepoint is now both production-code clean and test-visible at the same path.
  - **Version-pinning regression test** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_pydantic_ai_factory.py`): four tests cover the loud-failure paths (`system_prompt=<str>`, `system_prompt=None`) and the precedence behaviour itself — `test_instructions_survive_non_empty_message_history` constructs an agent with `instructions=<sentinel>` via the factory, runs it against `pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel` with a non-empty `message_history`, and asserts the sentinel is delivered to the model (either as a `SystemPromptPart` or via `ModelRequest.instructions`). If a future pydantic-ai release changes precedence so `instructions=` is also dropped under non-empty history, this test fails loudly so the regression is caught before silently shipping.
  - **Dependency pin commentary** (`requirements/base.txt:51`): the `pydantic-ai>=1.89.1,<2` line now carries a multi-line comment documenting that this codebase relies on the current `instructions=` precedence rule and pointing future maintainers at the regression test before widening the upper bound.

- **E2E spec for threads/discussions** (`frontend/tests/e2e/threads-discussions.spec.ts`):
  - Anonymous pass renders `/discussions` (filter pills, search box, "Corpus Discussions" section header) and `/threads` (search route) without authentication.
  - Authenticated pass logs in, creates a per-run corpus (suffixed with `Date.now()` to avoid collisions across retries), opens its inline discussions view via `?view=discussions`, fills the `CreateThreadForm` modal (title, optional description, ProseMirror initial message), posts a top-level reply through the `ReplyForm` composer, navigates back to the thread list, and confirms the new thread surfaces in the global `/discussions` "Corpus Discussions" section before clicking through to the detail.
  - Picked up automatically by the existing `frontend-e2e.yml` workflow — no CI changes required.
- **Three reusable E2E helpers** in `frontend/tests/e2e/helpers.ts`:
  - `openCorpusDiscussionsViaUI` — SPA-navigates to a corpus and opens its inline discussions view; waits on the "All" filter pill as the readiness signal.
  - `createThreadViaUI` — clicks the `aria-label="Create new discussion"` CTA, fills the modal (scoped via the `#thread-title` anchor), submits the composer, and waits for the thread-detail header.
  - `postThreadReplyViaUI` — types into the bottom `ReplyForm` ProseMirror editor and clicks Send, returning once the new message text is visible.

### Removed

- **Stray planning artifacts at repo root** (Issue #1453): deleted `plan.md` (CorpusHome query-performance optimization plan) and `plans/routing-audit-report.md` (frontend routing audit). Both described work that has already shipped — `CountableConnection.resolve_total_count()` already calls `.count()` directly (`config/graphql/base.py:88`) and `browseRoutes` already includes `"discussions"` (`frontend/src/utils/navigationUtils.ts:177`). The `plans/` directory is now gone; future planning docs belong under `docs/plans/` or `docs/architecture/` per existing conventions.

### Fixed

- **Annotation deep-links from the corpus-home Table of Contents silently no-op'd** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/DocumentAnnotationIndex.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/document_kb/RightPanelContent.tsx`): clicking a structural section in the corpus-home document index (e.g. "Subchapter I. Formation, p. 2") was supposed to open the document with the annotation pre-selected and scrolled into view. Instead it appeared to do nothing. Root cause: `DocumentAnnotationIndex` overloaded a single `embedded` prop with two semantics — visual layout ("render without an outer container") *and* click routing ("we are already on the document page, just rewrite `?ann=`"). The corpus-home call site (`DocumentTableOfContents.tsx:919`) needed the visual flavor but absolutely was *not* on a document page, so `handleSectionClick` took the wrong branch and wrote `?ann=<id>` onto the corpus URL — no navigation, no scroll. Fix splits the prop: `embedded` is now purely visual, and a new explicit `onDocumentPage` prop controls click routing. The single call site that's actually on a document page (`RightPanelContent.tsx`) opts in. Regression test in `frontend/src/components/corpuses/__tests__/DocumentAnnotationIndex.test.tsx` pins the new contract: a click from a corpus URL must produce a string-form `navigate("/d/.../doc?ann=<id>")` (full deep link), while a click from a document URL with `onDocumentPage` produces `navigate({ search: "...ann=<id>..." }, { replace: true })`.

- **Zip importer reported `success: True` even when sidecars failed (silent annotation loss)** (`opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks.py:421`, `:1411`): `_read_sidecar` raises `ValueError` when a sidecar exceeds `ZIP_MAX_SIDECAR_SIZE_BYTES`; malformed JSON, schema failures, and missing labels for sidecar-declared annotations all bump `annotation_sidecars_errored` and append to `errors`. The success determinations only checked `files_errored` (`import_zip_with_folder_structure`) or the user-cap message (`process_documents_zip`), so callers observed `success: True, completed: True` while annotations were silently dropped — exactly the silent data-loss path called out in PR #1489 review feedback. `import_zip_with_folder_structure` now requires `annotation_sidecars_errored == 0` in addition to the existing `files_errored == 0` and user-cap check; `process_documents_zip` now requires `error_files == 0` in addition to the user-cap check. `relationship_errors` is intentionally not folded in — those are surfaced separately via `relationships_skipped` + `relationship_errors` and the documents themselves are imported correctly. Two tests in `test_sidecar_import.py` (`test_skip_pipeline_without_labels_json`) and a new regression test (`test_sidecar_error_drops_overall_success_flag`) lock down the new contract.

- **`_create_analysis_notification` was reading a non-existent field on `Analyzer`** (Issue #1471, `opencontractserver/analyzer/views.py:50`). The notification builder for completed/failed analyses was reading `analysis.analyzer.analyzer_id`, but `Analyzer` has no such field — its primary key is `id` (a `CharField(max_length=1024, primary_key=True)`). On a real ORM instance every successful or failed remote-analyzer notification raised `AttributeError` inside the builder before the `Notification` row was written. Production tests in `opencontractserver/tests/test_job_notifications.py` masked the bug by mocking the entire `Analysis` instance with `MagicMock()` and setting `analysis.analyzer.analyzer_id = "test-analyzer"` (MagicMock auto-creates any attribute on access). Fix replaces the bad attribute with `analysis.analyzer.id`. A follow-up integration test using a real `Analyzer` instance is tracked in the issue.
- **Preferred Embedder dropdown showed disabled embedders for superusers** (`frontend/src/components/widgets/CRUD/EmbedderSelector.tsx`, `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`): the create/edit corpus form's `EmbedderSelector` listed every embedder returned by `pipelineComponents.embedders`. The backend resolver in `config/graphql/pipeline_queries.py` only filters by configured/preferred class names for non-superusers, so a superuser saw embedders that `PipelineSettings.enabled_components` had explicitly disallowed and could pick one the rest of the system would refuse to use. The `enabled` flag was already computed and exposed on `PipelineComponentType` but the `GET_EMBEDDERS` query did not request it. Added `enabled` to the query and filter `embedder.enabled !== false` on the client (`undefined` from older backends still passes through). Test mocks in `frontend/tests/EmbedderSelector.ct.tsx` and `frontend/tests/corpus-modal.ct.tsx` updated, and a new test case verifies a `enabled: false` embedder is omitted from the dropdown.

### Changed

- **Annotation sidecar size limit raised and made env-configurable** (`opencontractserver/constants/zip_import.py:49`, `config/settings/base.py:730`): the per-sidecar JSON cap during zip import was 10 MB, which silently dropped annotations for larger corpora — `_read_sidecar` (`opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks.py:572`) raised `ValueError` and the importer recorded it under `errors` while still returning `success: True, completed: True`, so callers had no signal that annotations were lost. Default raised to 50 MB and the setting is now read from the `ZIP_MAX_SIDECAR_SIZE_BYTES` env var via `django-environ` in `config/settings/base.py`, mirroring the pattern used for `MAX_WORKER_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES` and friends. The constants module's `getattr(settings, ...)` fallback was bumped to 50 MB so non-Django importers see the same default. Existing tests in `opencontractserver/tests/test_sidecar_import.py` patch the constant directly and are unaffected.

- **Remaining zip-import limits are now env-configurable** (`config/settings/base.py:730`, `opencontractserver/constants/zip_import.py`): `ZIP_MAX_FILE_COUNT`, `ZIP_MAX_TOTAL_SIZE_BYTES`, `ZIP_MAX_SINGLE_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`, `ZIP_MAX_COMPRESSION_RATIO`, `ZIP_MAX_FOLDER_DEPTH`, `ZIP_MAX_FOLDER_COUNT`, `ZIP_MAX_PATH_COMPONENT_LENGTH`, `ZIP_MAX_PATH_LENGTH`, and `ZIP_DOCUMENT_BATCH_SIZE` previously honored Django settings overrides via `getattr(settings, ...)` in the constants module but were not surfaced in `base.py`, so operators could only override them in code, not via environment variables. Each now has a matching `int(env(...))` entry in `base.py` with the same default the constants module already used, and the constants-module docstring documents the env-var path. No behavior change at the defaults.

- **Typing: graduate `opencontractserver.{agents,analyzer,discovery.views}` from mypy baseline** (refs Issue #1447): removed seven `[mypy-…]` `ignore_errors` blocks (`opencontractserver.agents.{admin,memory,models}`, `opencontractserver.analyzer.{utils,views}`, `opencontractserver.discovery.views`) and pruned 32 baseline error lines from `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`. The `discovery.tests.test_discovery_views` test module stays on the baseline — its 49 errors come from `setUpTestData` class-attribute assignments that mypy can't follow without per-test refactoring. Per-file fixes:
  - `analyzer/views.py` — fixed real bug: replaced `analysis.analyzer.analyzer_id` with `analysis.analyzer.id` (see Fixed above).
  - `analyzer/utils.py` — added `# type: ignore[assignment]` on the `get_doc_analyzer_task_by_name = None` ImportError fallback (mypy sees the original as `Callable`); switched the gating check from `not get_doc_analyzer_task_by_name` (truthy-function warning) to `is None`; cast `AnalyzerManifest` to `dict(...)` before `is_dict_instance_of_typed_dict()` since the helper expects a plain dict at runtime.
  - `agents/models.py` — scoped `# type: ignore[override]` on two `visible_to_user(user)` overrides in `AgentConfigurationManager` / `AgentActionResultManager` (django-stubs flags signature drift from `BaseVisibilityManager`); scoped `# type: ignore[misc]` on the two `objects = ...Manager()` declarations (manager class-vs-instance reassignment); added narrowing assertion on `self.corpus.title` in `AgentConfiguration.__str__` (the model `CheckConstraint` already enforces `corpus__isnull=False` when `scope == "CORPUS"`).
  - `agents/memory.py` — added narrowing `assert corpus.memory_document is not None` in the `IntegrityError` re-read branch (the truthy `corpus.memory_document_id` already proves the FK is set); added `list[str]` annotation on `result_parts` in the no-query memory-injection branch.
  - `agents/admin.py` — scoped `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` on the eight `admin_method.short_description = "..."` and one `admin_order_field = "..."` Django-admin annotation patterns mypy can't model; collapsed `obj.document.title[:30]` truncation into a single `doc_title or ""` binding so the slice no longer hits `str | None`.
  - `discovery/views.py` — scoped `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` on `Document.objects.filter(...).search_by_embedding(...)` (django-stubs returns generic `QuerySet[Document, Document]`, not the project's `DocumentQuerySet` which mixes in `VectorSearchViaEmbeddingMixin`).

- **Typing: graduate `opencontractserver.corpuses.*` from mypy baseline** (refs Issue #1447): removed five `[mypy-…]` `ignore_errors` blocks (`opencontractserver.corpuses.{admin,checks,folder_service,managers,models}`) and pruned 166 baseline error lines from `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`. Per-file fixes:
  - `corpuses/checks.py` — typed `errors: list[Warning] = []` accumulator.
  - `corpuses/folder_service.py` — replaced the `if TYPE_CHECKING: User = get_user_model()` runtime-call-as-type pattern with a direct `from opencontractserver.users.models import User` (cleared 50+ "User is not valid as a type" errors with one edit).
  - `corpuses/managers.py` — added `lightweight: bool = False` parameter to `CorpusActionExecutionManager.visible_to_user` and forwarded it to `super()`, aligning the signature with `BaseVisibilityManager` (proper signature fix instead of suppression).
  - `corpuses/admin.py` — scoped `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` on the eight `admin_method.short_description = "..."` and one `admin_order_field = "..."` Django-admin annotation patterns mypy can't model.
  - `corpuses/models.py` — added `author_obj: AbstractBaseUser` annotation in `update_description` so the `int → User` and `User → User` branches share a unified type; scoped `# type: ignore[misc]` on five `creator=user` kwargs and one `author=author_obj` kwarg passed to `Document` / `DocumentPath` / `CorpusDescriptionRevision.objects.create(...)` (django-stubs widens the FK target type to `User | Combinable` while the call sites pass `AbstractBaseUser`); scoped `# type: ignore[arg-type]` on `set_permissions_for_obj_to_user(user, ...)`; scoped `# type: ignore[misc]` on the lambda in `transaction.on_commit(...)` (mypy cannot infer the captured-default-arg lambda); added narrowing `assert document is not None` in the `remove_document` else-branch (the early `if not document and not path: raise` guard already establishes the invariant); scoped `# type: ignore[assignment]` on the `CorpusActionTemplate.creator = ForeignKey(..., null=True)` field redeclaration (intentional override of `BaseOCModel.creator` to use `SET_NULL`); scoped `# type: ignore[misc]` on the `objects = CorpusActionExecutionManager()` manager override; scoped `# type: ignore[return-value,arg-type]` on the `cls.objects.bulk_create(executions)` return in `bulk_queue_executions` (the `cls(...)` instances are typed as `Self` but the function explicitly returns `list[CorpusActionExecution]`); dropped two now-dead `# type: ignore[arg-type]` comments on `md_description.open(...)` calls and one on `descendants(include_self=True)`.

- **Typing: graduate `opencontractserver.llms.tools.*` from mypy baseline** (refs Issue #1447): removed seven `[mypy-…]` `ignore_errors` blocks (`core_tools` + `core_tools.*` wildcard, `image_tools`, `moderation_tools`, `pydantic_ai_tools`, `tool_factory`, `tool_registry`) and pruned 25 baseline error lines from `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`. Per-file fixes:
  - `core_tools/_helpers.py` — dropped three dead `# type: ignore` comments on `channels.db` / `asgiref.sync` imports (the partial-call concern doesn't surface under current type stubs).
  - `core_tools/text_extracts.py` / `core_tools/descriptions.py` — dropped four dead `# type: ignore[arg-type]` comments on `FieldFile.read()` / `.open()` calls.
  - `core_tools/links.py` — added a trailing `raise ValueError(f"Unhandled entity_type: {entity_type!r}")` to both `create_markdown_link` and `acreate_markdown_link` so mypy sees the function as exhaustive (without converting an unreachable to an opaque `AssertionError`).
  - `core_tools/notes.py` — widened `search_document_notes` / `asearch_document_notes` return type from `list[dict[str, str | int]]` to `list[dict[str, str | int | None]]`. The previous annotation was a real lie: `note.created.isoformat() if note.created else None` could already produce `None` values.
  - `core_tools/document_summaries.py` — replaced `author or author_id` with an explicit `summary_author = author if author is not None else author_id` + narrowing assertion; the early `if author is None and author_id is None: raise ValueError(...)` guard establishes the invariant the assertion locks down.
  - `image_tools.py` — removed redundant `images: list[ImageData] = []` re-annotation that conflicted with an earlier `images = _load_images_from_annotation_file(...)` binding; scoped a `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` on `Document.objects.filter(...).visible_to_user(user)` (django-stubs returns generic `QuerySet[Document, Document]`, not the project's custom `PermissionQuerySet`).
  - `moderation_tools.py` — scoped `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` on `message._skip_signals = True` (runtime convention, not a model field).
  - `pydantic_ai_tools.py` — typed `PydanticAIDependencies.vector_store` as `Optional[CoreAnnotationVectorStore]` (was `CoreAnnotationVectorStore` with `default=None` — a latent Pydantic validation bug); scoped `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` on the four `async_wrapper.<attr> = ...` metadata assignments used for pydantic-ai introspection and approval-gate wiring.
  - `tool_factory.py` — hoisted `param_descriptions = self.metadata.parameter_descriptions or {}` out of the `sig.parameters` loop so `.get()` no longer hits `Optional[dict[str, str]]`.
  - `tool_registry.py` — tightened `tool_class: type | None` to `tool_class: type[BaseTool] | None`; added `TYPE_CHECKING` imports for `BaseTool` / `CoreTool`; dropped the now-unnecessary `# noqa: F821` on `to_core_tool`.

- **Typing: graduate `opencontractserver.shared.{QuerySets,fields,mixins}` from mypy baseline** (refs Issue #1447): removed three `[mypy-…]` `ignore_errors` blocks (`opencontractserver.shared.QuerySets`, `opencontractserver.shared.fields`, `opencontractserver.shared.mixins`) and pruned 10 baseline error lines from `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`. The remaining `Managers` and `decorators` modules still have substantial typing surfaces (django-stubs limitations around dynamic `from_queryset`, `self.model.objects` generic narrowing, etc.) and stay on the baseline for follow-up work. Per-file fixes:
  - `opencontractserver/shared/QuerySets.py` — replaced two `timezone.timedelta(...)` calls with `datetime.timedelta(...)`. `django.utils.timezone` re-exports `timedelta` only as a runtime alias; the django-stubs package does not expose it on the public `timezone` module surface.
  - `opencontractserver/shared/fields.py` — scoped `# type: ignore[override]` on `NullableJSONField.formfield(**kwargs)` since the variadic kwargs signature intentionally differs from `Field.formfield`'s positional defaults.
  - `opencontractserver/shared/mixins.py` — scoped `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` on `self.filter(...)` in `VectorSearchViaEmbeddingMixin.search_by_embedding` (provided by the QuerySet base the mixin is combined with at the concrete subclass level), and on two `self.creator` references in `HasEmbeddingMixin.add_embedding` / `add_embeddings` (provided by the model base the mixin is combined with).

- **Typing: graduate small single-file packages from mypy baseline** (refs Issue #1447): removed eight `[mypy-…]` `ignore_errors` blocks (`config.urls`, `config.jwt_utils`, `config.ratelimit.decorators`, `config.graphql_auth0_auth.utils`, `opencontractserver.conftest`, `opencontractserver.feedback.models`, `opencontractserver.worker_uploads.views`, `opencontractserver.examples.structured_response_example`) and pruned 14 baseline error lines from `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`. Per-file fixes:
  - `config/urls.py` — replaced `settings.USE_SILK` with `getattr(settings, "USE_SILK", False)`. `USE_SILK` is only defined in `config/settings/local.py`, so the bare `settings.USE_SILK` access only worked because `mypy.ini` was muting the file; the `getattr` form is what other optional settings already use.
  - `config/jwt_utils.py` — replaced the runtime `User = get_user_model()` (which mypy treats as a value, not a type) with a `TYPE_CHECKING` import of `opencontractserver.users.models.User` and quoted return-type strings.
  - `config/ratelimit/decorators.py` — added `count: int | str` annotation so the `count, period_name, retry_after = "?", "period", 60` fallback (taken when `parse_rate(rate)` raises `ValueError`/`IndexError`) doesn't conflict with the `int` inferred from the success branch.
  - `config/graphql_auth0_auth/utils.py` — JWKS endpoints publish public keys only, but `cryptography` stubs widen `RSAAlgorithm.from_jwk` to `RSAPrivateKey | RSAPublicKey`. Added a localised `assert isinstance(public_key, RSAPublicKey)` before passing the key to `jwt.decode` so the union narrows correctly.
  - `opencontractserver/conftest.py` — wrapped `UserFactory()` in `cast(User, ...)` since the factory class returns a generic `UserFactory` instance under mypy.
  - `opencontractserver/feedback/models.py` — scoped `# type: ignore[misc]` on the `objects = UserFeedbackManager()` manager override (django-stubs flags the re-declaration as overriding a class variable).
  - `opencontractserver/worker_uploads/views.py` — replaced three `token: CorpusAccessToken = request.auth` assignments with `cast(CorpusAccessToken, request.auth)` so the DRF `Token | Any` return type narrows to the project's `CorpusAccessToken` subclass.
  - `opencontractserver/examples/structured_response_example.py` — added `set[str]` annotation on the `all_parties` aggregator.

- **Badge tile overflow fix on community leaderboard** (`frontend/src/components/badges/Badge.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/community/Leaderboard.tsx`): long badge names previously broke out of their `BadgeCard` containers in the leaderboard grid because the card was a horizontal flex (`flex-direction: row`) with no flex-shrink hint, and `StyledBadge`/`BadgeName` did not allow word-break. Switched `BadgeCard` to a vertical layout (`flex-direction: column`, `align-items: flex-start`, `gap: 12px`, `min-width: 0`) so the icon stacks above the metadata and the badge can fully consume the card width; added `overflow-wrap: anywhere` plus `max-width: 100%` to `StyledBadge` and `overflow-wrap: anywhere` to `BadgeName` so very long names break at any character. `BadgeMeta` was switched from `flex: 1` to `width: 100%` to size correctly under the new column direction. `Badge.tsx`'s wrapper `<motion.span>` also gets an inline `maxWidth: "100%"` so badges constrained by ancestor flex layouts cannot escape their parent. Affects every screen that renders a `Badge` (the column-direction `BadgeCard` change is leaderboard-scoped).

- **Consolidate inline document READ checks onto `visible_to_user`** (Issue #1450, `config/graphql/document_types.py`): four resolvers (`resolve_page_annotations`, `resolve_page_relationships`, `resolve_relationship_summary`, `resolve_extract_annotation_summary`) each repeated the same hand-rolled `if not self.is_public: ... user != self.creator and not user.is_superuser ... user_has_permission_for_obj(user, self, READ)` block. The fallback to `user_has_permission_for_obj` for a Document READ check is the exact anti-pattern the helper's docstring warns against — it ignores corpus context and other visibility rules. Replaced all four blocks with a single private helper, `DocumentType._assert_user_can_read`, which delegates to `Document.objects.visible_to_user(user).filter(id=self.id).exists()` and raises a `GraphQLError` (`Authentication required` for anonymous, `do not have access` for authenticated). Behavior is preserved for the public/anonymous/owner/superuser/sharee/no-access matrix and is now driven by the canonical visibility manager. New unit suite `opencontractserver/tests/test_document_type_read_permission.py` locks the helper's contract.

- **Leaderboard page redesigned to match the OS Legal design system** (`frontend/src/components/community/Leaderboard.tsx`):
  - Replaced custom gradient/inline-style sections with a hero header, `StatGrid`-based community stats, and named styled components for every compound element (`UsernameCell`, `ScoreCell`, `DetailsCell`, `RisingStarTag`, `BadgeCard`, `BadgeMeta`, `BadgeName`, `BadgeStats`).
  - `RankBadge` palette tokenised into a file-local `RANK_COLORS` map and `RisingStarTag` colours into `RISING_STAR_COLORS`; rank-2 surface/border/text now reuse `OS_LEGAL_COLORS` tokens directly.
  - Bumped `RisingStarTag` font-size from 11px to 12px (WCAG 2.1 small-text floor).
  - Removed unused `GradientSegment` import and `statsLoading` variable.

- **Consistent MCP discoverability across corpus tiles and detail pages** (`frontend/src/components/common/MCPShareButton.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusListView.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome/CorpusLandingView.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome/CorpusDetailsView.tsx`):
  - The MCP share button now renders for every corpus that has a slug, not just public ones, and the tile overlay is always visible (no longer fades in on hover).
  - `MCPShareButton` accepts a new `isPublic` prop. For private corpora the popover shows a `Lock` icon and explains that the corpus must be made public before an MCP endpoint is exposed (the backend MCP server only serves public corpora — `opencontractserver/mcp/server.py`).
  - The redundant "MCP Endpoint" entry in the corpus tile context menu was removed; the always-visible overlay button is now the single canonical entry point.

- **Extract pipeline cleanup pass** (Issue #1410): hardens the extraction-related plumbing introduced by #1381 / #1380 / #1399 against three medium-impact failure modes and four documentation/observability gaps surfaced during code review.
  - **`opencontractserver/tasks/embeddings_task.py:_batch_embed_text_annotations`** — Transient HTTP errors (`requests.Timeout`, `requests.ConnectionError`, `EmbeddingServerError`) now drop queued sub-batches and shut down the `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `wait=False, cancel_futures=True` before re-raising. Previously the exception propagated out of the `with` block, which calls `shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=False)` by default and blocked Celery autoretry by up to ~`max_workers` × the per-sub-batch round-trip latency. In-flight HTTP calls cannot be torn down from Python, but at least we no longer wait on them.
  - **`opencontractserver/benchmarks/loader.py:force_celery_eager`** — Refuses to mutate the global Celery config unless `settings.MODE == "TEST"` *or* the new `OC_BENCHMARK_CLI` env var is set; outside test mode also refuses when `task_always_eager` is already `True` (concurrent benchmark runs would race on the global save/restore). In test mode an already-`True` flag is the ambient state imposed by `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=True`, so the helper is a no-op there. The `run_benchmark` management command now sets `OC_BENCHMARK_CLI=1` automatically. Prevents the benchmark helper from silently routing every task in a live web/worker process through the in-process executor.
  - **`opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`** — `PydanticAICorpusAgent._build_structured_system_prompt` now says "most legal corpora need multiple targeted queries" instead of "most legal documents …" — corpora-scoped wording for the corpus agent. The document-agent prompt is unchanged.
  - **`config/settings/test.py`** — The `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER` env-var override is now gated behind an explicit `BENCHMARK_MODE=1` env var. Without that opt-in, a stray `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER` value in the CI environment would silently push the regular test suite onto a real embedder and start making live network calls. The default `TestEmbedder` keeps regular `pytest` runs hermetic.
  - **`opencontractserver/tasks/data_extract_tasks.py`** — When `model_override` is accepted in the unrestricted (operator-only) path because `BENCHMARK_ALLOWED_MODEL_OVERRIDES` is unset, a `WARNING`-level log line now records the override + cell ID. WARNING (not INFO) because the open mode is a misconfiguration / abuse signal — anything firing it from a web/GraphQL caller is a real anomaly that should reach log aggregation. Lets operators `grep` production logs to confirm the open mode is fired only by the benchmark tooling and never by an unexpected web/GraphQL caller.
  - **`opencontractserver/pipeline/utils.py:get_default_reranker_instance`** — Docstring now warns that `bulk_update` / `QuerySet.update` / data-migration writes to `PipelineSettings.default_reranker` bypass the `auto_now` `modified` field used as part of the cache key, so callers who mutate the singleton via those paths must also call `invalidate_reranker_cache()` (or touch `modified` explicitly).

### Documentation

- **Auth0 admin-claim namespace mismatch** (`docs/configuration/authentication.md`): documented a silent failure mode where the Post-Login Action's `namespace` constant doesn't match `AUTH0_ADMIN_CLAIM_NAMESPACE` (e.g. `https://opencontracts.opensource.legal/` vs the default `https://contracts.opensource.legal/`). When the namespaces don't match byte-for-byte, the backend's fail-closed sync (`config/graphql_auth0_auth/utils.py:sync_admin_claims_from_payload`) treats the claims as missing and overwrites `is_staff` / `is_superuser` to `False` on every authenticated request, so the frontend admin link in the user dropdown never appears even though `app_metadata.is_superuser = true` is set in Auth0. Added a `!!! danger` callout to the Post-Login Action setup section and expanded the "Admin claim missing, defaulting to False" troubleshooting entry with the namespace-mismatch case and a `!!! info` note explaining why missing claims revoke admin instead of being ignored.

### Security

- **Audit + IDOR-pattern hardening of the four largest GraphQL mutation modules** (Issue #1449): completed the preventative permission audit called for in #1449 across `config/graphql/document_mutations.py` (1,673 lines), `config/graphql/corpus_mutations.py` (1,480 lines), `config/graphql/extract_mutations.py` (1,312 lines), and `config/graphql/annotation_mutations.py` (883 lines). Findings + fixes:
  - **Per-file verdict**: `extract_mutations.py` is fully covered (every user-supplied ID is loaded through `Model.objects.visible_to_user(user)` or guarded by `user_has_permission_for_obj` with creator/public Q-filters, and error messages are uniform). `corpus_mutations.py`, `document_mutations.py`, and `annotation_mutations.py` were mostly safe but had a handful of resolvers that loaded objects via raw `Model.objects.get(pk=...)` and then either skipped the visibility check, deferred it to a service, or returned a *different* error message for "not found" vs "permission denied" — the exact IDOR-enumeration smell `CLAUDE.md` warns about.
  - **`config/graphql/annotation_mutations.py`** — `RemoveRelationships` (line ~489), `UpdateRelationship` (line ~550), `UpdateRelations` (line ~690), and `UpdateNote` (line ~741) now load the target object through `Relationship.objects.visible_to_user(user)` / `Note.objects.visible_to_user(user)` before any permission gating. All branches ("relationship not found", "permission denied", "note not found", "not creator") collapse to one shared error string per mutation so an attacker cannot distinguish "ID does not exist" from "ID exists but is not yours". `UpdateRelationship` additionally filters add-source / add-target annotation IDs through `Annotation.objects.visible_to_user(user)` instead of `Annotation.objects.filter(id__in=...)`, and short-circuits with the same unified message when any requested ID is invisible. Removal paths now restrict deletion to annotations actually attached to the relationship (via `relationship.source_annotations.filter(id__in=...)`) so removal cannot leak the existence of unrelated annotation IDs even though the relationship-level UPDATE check still gates the operation.
  - **`config/graphql/document_mutations.py`** — `EmptyTrash` (line ~1470), `RestoreDocumentToVersion` (lines ~1529–1530), `UploadDocument` (line ~200, corpus load), `UploadDocumentsZip` (line ~575), and `ImportZipToCorpus` (line ~922) now route corpus/document loads through `Corpus.objects.visible_to_user(user)` / `Document.objects.visible_to_user(user)`. The "corpus not found" and "you don't have permission to add documents to this corpus" branches in the upload mutations were merged into a single unified message, and `RestoreDocumentToVersion`'s separate "document version not found" / "corpus not found" / "you don't have permission to restore this document" / "you don't have permission to modify this corpus" branches were collapsed into one IDOR-safe string.
  - **`config/graphql/corpus_mutations.py`** — `UpdateCorpusDescription` (line ~266) now goes through `Corpus.objects.visible_to_user(user)` and returns the same message whether the corpus does not exist, the caller cannot see it, or the caller can see it but is not the creator. `AddDocumentsToCorpus` (line ~365) and `RemoveDocumentsFromCorpus` (line ~424) likewise route the corpus load through `visible_to_user(user)` instead of relying solely on the `DocumentFolderService` write-permission check that runs immediately afterwards. `RunCorpusAction` (line ~1284) now carries an explicit `assert user.is_superuser` and a comment documenting that its raw `CorpusAction.objects.get(...)` / `Document.objects.get(...)` calls are intentional because the resolver is gated by `@user_passes_test(lambda user: user.is_superuser)`.
  - **Test updates** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_permission_fixes.py`): the existing `RemoveRelationships` and `UpdateRelations` IDOR tests were updated to assert the new unified error string instead of the old per-branch messages. Test *intent* is unchanged — they still verify that an unauthorized user and a user supplying a non-existent ID receive byte-identical responses — only the expected literal changed because the mutations now use the harmonised wording. No production behaviour outside the audited mutations was modified.
  - **What was not changed**: `extract_mutations.py` was left as-is (already compliant); `RetryDocumentProcessing` in `document_mutations.py` was left as-is because its raw load is followed immediately by a `user_has_permission_for_obj` check that already returns the *same* "Document not found" string for both branches, so the IDOR pattern is preserved despite the load shape; `AddTemplateToCorpus`'s raw `CorpusActionTemplate.objects.get(pk=...)` is intentional per the in-line docstring (templates are global) and was left in place pending a separate decision on whether template publishing should ever become user-scoped.

### Fixed

- **Blob retention across corpus-isolated Document copies** (Issue #1464): `Corpus.add_document()` and the document-versioning helpers create corpus-isolated *copies* of a `Document` whose file fields (`pdf_file`, `txt_extract_file`, `pawls_parse_file`, `icon`, `md_summary_file`) intentionally point to the SAME S3 blobs as the source. Until now, exactly one production code path (`update_memory_content` in `opencontractserver/agents/memory.py:237`) called `txt_extract_file.delete(save=False)` unconditionally — meaning any memory document copy-shared between two corpora via `Corpus.add_document()` would see its blob silently destroyed in the sibling corpus on the next memory update. Detection was masked by `FileSystemStorage`'s path-reuse semantics: `delete()` followed by `save(SAME_NAME, …)` writes to the same path, so the sibling's `txt_extract_file.name` still resolves but reads back the *new* (foreign-corpus) content — a quiet data-corruption failure, not a 404.
  - **Defensive coverage spans every Document `FileField`, not just the one current call site.** The fix introduces a generic primitive that protects all five file fields uniformly so that the upcoming orphan-cleanup work (Issue #1492) inherits the sharing-check for free.
  - **New manager method** (`opencontractserver/shared/Managers.py`): `Document.objects.unique_blob_paths(doc)` returns the set of file-field blob paths on `doc` that are NOT referenced by any other live `Document` row. The method derives its FileField list from `Document._meta.get_fields()`, so adding a new `FileField` to the model extends coverage automatically.
  - **New model method** (`opencontractserver/documents/models.py`): `Document.safe_delete_field_blob(field_name, *, save=False)` is the single, public chokepoint for freeing a blob in storage. Empty field → no-op; unique blob → `FieldFile.delete()`; shared blob → field cleared on this row only, blob retained in storage. Validates that `field_name` resolves to a `FileField` on the model and raises `ValueError` for typos so silent no-ops can't hide. Any code in this codebase that needs to delete a blob from storage MUST go through this primitive instead of calling `FieldFile.delete()` directly.
  - **Guard at the one current production call site** (`opencontractserver/agents/memory.py:241`): the inline shared-blob check is replaced with a single call to `locked_doc.safe_delete_field_blob("txt_extract_file")`. The behavioural contract is identical; the logic now lives on the model where every future caller can find it.
  - **Regression coverage** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_blob_retention.py`, 4 `TransactionTestCase` classes):
    - `UniqueBlobPathsTestCase` (4 tests) — pins the manager method's contract: solitary docs own all blobs, shared blobs are excluded for both source and copy, per-field uniqueness after partial overwrite, empty fields produce no `""` entries.
    - `SafeDeleteFieldBlobTestCase` (5 tests) — exercises the primitive across **every** `FileField` on Document (parameterized via `DOCUMENT_FILE_FIELDS`): unique blobs are removed from storage, shared blobs are retained for the sibling, empty fields are no-ops, invalid field names raise, non-FileField names raise.
    - `MemoryDocumentBlobRetentionTestCase` (2 tests) — content-equality assertion that catches the actual failure mode: after `update_memory_content` on corpus A, sibling in corpus B still reads its original content. Failed pre-fix, passes post-fix.
    - `DocumentDeleteBlobRetentionTestCase` (2 tests, parameterized across all FileFields) — issue-spec invariant: `Document.delete()` does not destroy a blob still referenced by a sibling. Passes today (default `Model.delete()` doesn't touch FileField blobs) and is the contract test for the row-delete path; it will become live coverage once the orphan-cleanup work in Issue #1492 lands the deletion mechanic.
  - **Forward pointer to Issue #1492**: this PR is the *defensive* half of the blob-retention contract ("don't delete shared blobs"). The complementary half ("reclaim truly orphaned blobs at row-delete time") is tracked separately and will reuse `Document.safe_delete_field_blob` so the sharing-check does not need to be re-implemented.
  - **Audit findings** (preserved in PR description): `django-cleanup` is not installed; no `pre_delete`/`post_delete` handlers on `Document` delete blobs (the existing handlers only GC `StructuralAnnotationSet`); `worker_uploads/tasks.py` deletes belong to `WorkerDocumentUpload.file`, a separate model; default `Model.delete()` does not delete FileField blobs.

- **MCP share popover clipped/obscured on corpus list tiles** (`frontend/src/components/common/MCPShareButton.tsx`): the popover was rendered inline inside `Container` with `position: absolute; z-index: 1000`, which left it subject to two ancestor problems on `CorpusListView`. (1) `PageContainer` sets `overflow-x: hidden`, so the popover's right edge was clipped on narrow viewports — particularly in responsive mode where the trigger sits near the right edge of the card. (2) Sibling card stacking contexts (each card's `MCPButtonOverlay` carries its own `z-index: 10` over `position: relative` cards) caused the popover from one card to render *behind* the next card down. Fix: portal the popover into `document.body`, switch it to `position: fixed`, compute its viewport coordinates from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()` (clamped within `POPOVER_VIEWPORT_MARGIN` so it can't overflow the viewport on either edge), and recompute on `scroll` (capture phase, to catch nested scrollers) and `resize`. Click-outside detection now checks both `containerRef` and the new `popoverRef` since the portaled popover is no longer a DOM descendant of the trigger.

- **Slow document loading on corpora with hundreds of documents** — opening the Documents tab on a large corpus blocked behind a 5+ second "Documents Loading…" spinner because the list query did O(N) work per document for relationship metadata:
  - **Frontend** (`frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`, `frontend/src/components/documents/ModernDocumentItem.tsx`): `GET_DOCUMENTS` no longer eagerly fetches `allDocRelationships` for every document on the page (each list page was pulling source/target/label rows for every linked document — 5,000+ extra fields on a corpus with 100 docs averaging 50 links). Added a new lazy `GET_DOC_RELATIONSHIPS_FOR_DOC` query (resolves through the existing `bulkDocRelationships` field) that fires the first time the user hovers/focuses a relationship badge on a document card. The hover popup's existing "Loading relationships…" placeholder covers the brief network round-trip. The `docRelationshipCount` badge still renders synchronously from the list query.
  - **Backend** (`opencontractserver/documents/query_optimizer.py`, `config/graphql/document_types.py`): replaced the per-document `.count()` call in `resolve_doc_relationship_count` with `DocumentRelationshipQueryOptimizer.get_relationship_counts_by_document` — a single pair of aggregated `GROUP BY` queries (one for source, one for target) that returns `{document_id: count}` for every document the user can see (optionally scoped by corpus). Result is cached on `info.context` keyed by user+corpus so all N badges in a single GraphQL response share the work. Eliminates the `Document.objects.get` + permission re-check + `select_related` query that previously ran once per document. For a 20-item page this collapses ~80 DB round-trips into 2.
  - **Backend** (`config/graphql/filters.py:in_folder`): the folder filter was materialising `DocumentPath` IDs into a Python `set()` (forcing eager evaluation) and running two extra `COUNT` queries purely for `logger.info` debug lines. Switched to a lazy `values()` queryset so Django emits a SQL subquery for the `__in` lookup and dropped the diagnostic counts — keeps the queryset fully lazy for downstream pagination.

- **Backend hardening for GraphQL CSRF / `Authorization` semantics** (Issue #1432, follow-up to #1431): the original fix already normalised empty / whitespace-only `Authorization` headers, but any *non-empty* value still bypassed CSRF. That left a defense-in-depth gap (a malformed scheme such as `Authorization: Basic …` was treated as evidence of token auth) and the production logs were still drowning in benign `Forbidden (CSRF token missing.)` warnings. Two-part hardening:
  - **Strict scheme validation** (`config/graphql/security.py:45-104`): added `_is_recognised_token_credential` which only accepts the `Authorization` header as a token credential when it splits into exactly `<scheme> <credential>`, the credential is non-empty, and the scheme matches a recognised prefix (currently `Bearer` plus the configured `API_TOKEN_PREFIX` when API-key auth is enabled). Scheme matching is case-insensitive per RFC 7235. Empty, whitespace-only, scheme-only (`Bearer`, `Bearer  `), and unrecognised-scheme (`Basic …`) values now fall through to the cookie-based path so a malformed header cannot smuggle a session-cookie request into the token-auth bypass. `conditional_csrf_exempt` was rewritten on top of this helper; the no-cookie anonymous bypass is preserved unchanged so Bearer-only SPA boot races still get a 200 on cold start.
  - **Log volume control** (`config/graphql/security.py:157-198`, `config/settings/base.py`, `config/settings/production.py`): introduced `CsrfRejectLogFilter`, a `logging.Filter` wired into the `django.security.csrf` logger that demotes the predictable `Forbidden (CSRF token missing. | CSRF cookie not set.)` WARNING to INFO. Genuine anomalies — origin mismatch, bad referer, mismatched token — keep their WARNING level so log shipping continues to surface them. The filter inspects `record.args[0]` against a small allow-list of benign reason strings; anything else is passed through unchanged.
  - **Test matrix expansion** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_security_hardening.py`): added the missing legs called out in #1432. New `TestConditionalCsrfExempt` cases — `test_unrecognized_scheme_with_session_enforces_csrf`, `test_unrecognized_scheme_without_session_bypasses_csrf`, `test_bearer_without_credential_with_session_enforces_csrf` (covers `"Bearer"`, `"Bearer "`, `"Bearer    "`), `test_bearer_with_credential_bypasses_csrf`, `test_bearer_scheme_is_case_insensitive`, `test_api_key_scheme_bypasses_csrf` (with `API_TOKEN_PREFIX` overridden so the test is independent of `ALLOW_API_KEYS`), and `test_session_with_csrf_token_passes` — close the positive session+CSRF path that the suite previously lacked. New `TestCsrfRejectLogVolume` covers the filter contract directly: `test_filter_demotes_csrf_token_missing_warning_to_info`, `test_filter_does_not_demote_other_csrf_reasons` (origin mismatch, bad referer, `CSRF token incorrect.`), and `test_filter_passes_unrelated_records_unchanged`.
  - **Out of scope** (per the issue): no SPA auth-model changes, no CSRF-token plumbing on the frontend.

- **System Settings page failed to load with `Enum 'FileTypeEnum' cannot represent value: 'md'`** (`config/graphql/pipeline_types.py:12`): the GraphQL `FileTypeEnum` was hand-maintained and only declared `PDF`/`TXT`/`DOCX`, but the backend `FileTypeEnum` has `MD = "md"` and `oc_markdown_parser.py` declares `supported_file_types = [FileTypeEnum.MD]`. When the pipeline-components query serialized the markdown parser's supported file types, the GraphQL enum could not represent `"md"` and the entire query failed. Replaced the hand-maintained class with `graphene.Enum.from_enum(BackendFileTypeEnum)` so the GraphQL enum is generated from the backend source of truth and the two can never drift again — adding a member to the backend enum now exposes it through the schema automatically.

- **Document annotator right sidebar: crowded tabs and unresponsive Chat panel**:
  - **Tabs visually merge when panel is open** (`frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/styled/SidebarTabs.tsx:78-93`): `SidebarTabsContainer` set `gap: 0` whenever the panel was open, so the four vertical tabs (Index, Chat, Feed, Discussions) butted up against each other along the panel's left edge with no separation. Replaced the conditional gap with a constant `gap: 6px`, restoring per-tab visual identity in both open and closed states.
  - **`NewChatFloatingButton` ignored panel bounds** (`frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/ChatContainers.tsx:587-606`): the FAB used `position: fixed; bottom: 2rem; right: 2rem`, anchoring it to the viewport instead of the chat panel — at 50% panel width the "+" button rendered over the document, not the chat tray, and didn't follow panel resizes. Switched to `position: absolute` so it tracks the `SlidingPanel`, with a softer offset (`1.5rem`) and a more visible shadow.
  - **Empty conversation list collapsed to a thin strip** (`frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/right_tray/ConversationListView.tsx:87-104`, `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/ChatContainers.tsx:389-399`): the list view's outer wrapper had no `flex: 1`/height, and `ConversationGrid` likewise didn't grow, so when no conversations existed the panel showed only the filter row over a sea of empty white. Made both flex-grow within their parent and added `grid-auto-rows: max-content` plus bottom padding so cards stack from the top and don't collide with the FAB.
  - **No empty-state messaging for Chat** (`frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/right_tray/ConversationListView.tsx:185-231`): added a centered empty state with a chat icon, "No conversations yet" heading, and a hint that nudges users toward the new-chat FAB. Gated on `conversations.length === 0` so it disappears as soon as data lands.

- **GraphQL POST 403 storm when Auth0 token is empty** (Issue #1431): production logs were filling with `Forbidden (CSRF token missing.): /graphql/` because the React frontend always sent `Authorization: ""` whenever the Auth0 access token was momentarily missing (startup race, silent-refresh failure, post-expiry re-mount), and `conditional_csrf_exempt` only bypassed CSRF when the header was _truthy_. An empty header fell through to Django's session/CSRF path even though the frontend never carries a CSRF token. Two-sided fix:
  - **Frontend** (`frontend/src/index.tsx:36-50`): conditional-spread `Authorization` so the header is omitted entirely when the token is empty rather than sent as the empty string.
  - **Backend** (`config/graphql/security.py:43-86`): refactored `conditional_csrf_exempt` to skip CSRF when **either** an `Authorization` header is present (Bearer / API-key — browsers don't auto-attach it) **or** no session cookie is present (the request is fully anonymous; without a cookie there is nothing for a cross-origin attacker to ride). Whitespace-only `Authorization` headers are now treated as missing. Session-cookie requests without a Bearer token still go through the existing CSRF check, so authenticated session traffic remains protected.
  - **Backend** (`config/graphql_auth0_auth/settings.py:73-79`): `Auth0JWTSettings.__getattr__` now raises `AttributeError` quietly for any name beginning with `_`, eliminating the `ERROR settings  Auth0JWTSettings.__getattr__() - Invalid setting requested: _user_settings` log noise emitted whenever Python internals (deepcopy / pickle / `hasattr`) probed dunder/private attributes. Unknown public settings still log an error.
  - **Tests** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_security_hardening.py`, `opencontractserver/tests/test_auth0_jwks_cache.py`): updated `test_session_auth_without_csrf_rejected` to inject a session cookie (so the CSRF path is actually exercised); added `test_anonymous_no_session_bypasses_csrf`, `test_empty_authorization_header_treated_as_missing`, and `test_empty_authorization_with_session_still_enforces_csrf` to lock in the new semantics; added `TestAuth0JWTSettingsDunderProbe` to assert that dunder/private probes don't emit error logs while unknown public settings still do.

- **Shared-protocol contract drift surfaced by PR #1400 follow-up review** (Issue #1408):
  - **`PermissionedQueryManagerProtocol.visible_to_user` signature mismatch** (`opencontractserver/types/protocols.py:147`): the protocol declared `visible_to_user(self, user: Any = None)` but `PermissionManager.visible_to_user` and `UserFeedbackManager.visible_to_user` have no default. A caller holding a protocol-typed reference could call `.visible_to_user()` with no args and trigger a runtime `TypeError`, and mypy would also reject the concrete classes as structural matches. Dropped the `= None` default so the protocol pins the strictest contract; the docstring now explains that callers must pass an `AnonymousUser` when no authenticated principal is available. Lenient managers (e.g. `BaseVisibilityManager` with `user=None`) still satisfy the protocol — verified with both `isinstance` and `issubclass` checks.
  - **`ToolProtocol` `@property` descriptors against a `@dataclass`** (`opencontractserver/types/protocols.py:97`): `CoreTool` is a `@dataclass` exposing `name` / `description` / `parameters` / `requires_approval` as plain instance attributes. Mypy accepted dataclass fields against the property-shaped protocol, but the asymmetry was a footgun for future implementors who would reach for `@property` based on the protocol surface. Converted to plain attribute declarations matching the concrete class.
  - **`StreamObserverProtocol` drift hazard** (`opencontractserver/types/protocols.py:152`): the protocol duplicated `opencontractserver.llms.types.StreamObserver` with no automated enforcement. A naive re-export creates a real circular-import risk because `protocols.py` is imported by `opencontractserver.shared.Managers` during Django app loading and `opencontractserver.llms.__init__` eagerly pulls in the heavy LLM stack (`api` → conversation models, agent factories). Kept duplicated definitions but added explicit "Must be kept in sync with…" notices on both sides (`opencontractserver/llms/types.py:18` and `opencontractserver/types/protocols.py:152`) explaining the rationale, and aligned the `__call__` return type on `llms.types.StreamObserver` (`-> None`, dropping the redundant `Awaitable[None]` wrapper that was already implicit in `async def`).
  - **`VectorStoreProtocol` test missed renames** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_protocols.py:24`): the canonical-implementation test used `hasattr` against hard-coded method names instead of the `@runtime_checkable` machinery used by the other three tests in the file. Renaming `search` / `async_search` would have left the test passing as long as the attribute names happened to exist via some other code path. Switched to `issubclass(CoreAnnotationVectorStore, VectorStoreProtocol)`, which executes the protocol's structural check without instantiating the class. The negative test for plain `object` was tightened from a manual `hasattr` to `issubclass(object, VectorStoreProtocol)` for symmetry.

### Added

- **Tests for issue #1410 fixes**:
  - `opencontractserver/tests/test_data_extract_failure_classification.py::PydanticAiSchemaCanaryTests` — Pin the pydantic-ai message-schema discriminators (`ModelResponse.kind == "response"`, `ToolCallPart.part_kind == "tool-call"`, `TextPart.part_kind == "text"`) so a future minor version that renames them surfaces immediately rather than silently flipping every `None` extraction into the `empty_history` mis-classification mode.
  - `opencontractserver/tests/test_batch_embedding.py::TestBatchEmbedTextAnnotations::test_transient_error_does_not_block_on_in_flight_peers` — Asserts the executor fast-fail path completes well inside the 10 s peer-block window. A regression that waits on in-flight peers (the previous default-shutdown behaviour) would take ~10 s and fail this test.
  - `opencontractserver/tests/test_benchmarks.py::ForceCeleryEagerSafetyGuardsTestCase` — Pins the three new `force_celery_eager` safety refusals: non-test mode without the CLI env var, non-test mode *with* the CLI env var (allowed), and stacked invocations (`task_always_eager` already `True`).

- **Extract iterations & cell-level diff** — surfaces the three eval workflows callers asked for (model drift, document-version drift, fieldset-config sweeps) without forking the data model. Two new fields on `Extract` chain a parent/child relationship and capture run-time model config; everything else reuses the existing extract → fieldset → datacell pipeline so storage, permissions, and the runner are unchanged.

  - **Migration `extracts/0029_extract_iterations.py`** — adds `Extract.parent_extract` (self-FK, indexed) and `Extract.model_config` (`NullableJSONField`). Both nullable so legacy extracts continue to load with no backfill.
  - **`opencontractserver/extracts/diff.py`** — pure helper (no Graphene, no DB writes) that takes two pre-permission-filtered `Datacell` iterables and produces aligned `(row_key, column_key)` rows classified `UNCHANGED | CHANGED | ONLY_IN_A | ONLY_IN_B`. Rows are aligned by `Document.version_tree_id` so a single logical document still appears once even when the two iterations point at different content versions. `corrected_data` wins over `data` when computing equality. `_column_config_signature` gates the `column_config_changed` flag on prompt/instructions/output_type/etc., not name — so a rename alone doesn't trip it.
  - **`config/graphql/extract_mutations.py:CreateExtractIteration`** — single mutation that forks an extract along `MODEL`, `DOCUMENT_VERSIONS`, or `FIELDSET`. MODEL and DOCUMENT_VERSIONS share the parent's fieldset (column definitions stay byte-identical for apples-to-apples comparison); FIELDSET deep-clones `Fieldset` + `Column` rows via `_clone_fieldset_for_iteration` with optional per-column overrides. DOCUMENT_VERSIONS re-resolves each parent doc to the row with `is_current=True` in its `version_tree_id`. `auto_start=True` queues the existing `run_extract` task on commit — no new orchestration code path. `parent_extract` is set on the new extract; default name is `<source> (iteration N)` with N counting existing siblings + 1. Permission gate: caller needs `READ` on the source extract.
  - **`opencontractserver/tasks/extract_orchestrator_tasks.py`** — `run_extract` reads `extract.model_config.get("model")` and forwards it as the existing `model_override` kwarg of `doc_extract_query_task` (originally added for the benchmark runner). New `_task_accepts_kwarg(task_func, name)` (LRU-cached) inspects the column task's signature so the kwarg is only forwarded to tasks that accept it — custom column tasks predating `model_override` keep working unchanged. No model_config → behaviour byte-identical to before.
  - **`config/graphql/extract_types.py`** — exposes `modelConfig`, `parentExtract`, `fullIterationList`, plus a derived `iterationAxis` field (`MODEL` if `model_config` differs from parent, `FIELDSET` if fieldset differs, `DOCUMENT_VERSIONS` if doc set differs, else null) so the frontend can badge iterations without persisting the axis.
  - **`config/graphql/extract_queries.py:compareExtracts(extractAId, extractBId)`** — returns `ExtractDiffType { extractA, extractB, cells, summary }` where `cells` is a list of `ExtractCellDiffType { rowKey, columnKey, document, documentA, documentB, cellA, cellB, status, columnConfigChanged }`. Permission check reuses `ExtractQueryOptimizer.check_extract_permission` so visibility rules stay consistent across the existing `extract` resolver and the diff resolver. Cells pulled via `ExtractQueryOptimizer.get_extract_datacells` — same optimizer (and permission filtering) on both sides of the diff.
  - **Frontend — `frontend/src/components/extracts/iterations/`**:
    - `ExtractIterationsTab.tsx` lives as a 4th tab (`Iterations`) on `ExtractDetailContent`. Lists every extract in the series (parent + current + iterations) with a status bullet, axis chip, and captured-model chip. Clicking two rows toggles a comparison view inline.
    - `NewIterationDialog.tsx` is the focused fork modal — three radio-style cards (model, document versions, schema), an optional name, an optional model identifier, and a "Run immediately" toggle that maps to `autoStart`.
    - `ExtractCompareView.tsx` runs `compareExtracts` and renders the heatmap: rows are documents, columns are the union of column names, each cell is colored by `DiffStatus` and clickable to open a fixed-position side panel showing the A/B JSON. Reuses `formatCellValue` from `frontend/src/utils/formatters.ts` so cell values look identical to the main extract grid. Summary chips (changed / only-in-A / only-in-B / unchanged) above the grid use the same palette as the cell borders so the legend and grid never drift.
  - **Frontend GraphQL** — `REQUEST_GET_EXTRACT` extended with `modelConfig`, `iterationAxis`, `parentExtract`, `fullIterationList`. New `COMPARE_EXTRACTS` query and `REQUEST_CREATE_EXTRACT_ITERATION` mutation live alongside the existing extract operations in `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts` / `mutations.ts`. `ExtractType` in `frontend/src/types/graphql-api.ts` gained the same four fields.
  - **Tests — `opencontractserver/tests/test_extract_iterations.py`** — `DiffHelperTestCase` exercises the diff algorithm directly (alignment by `version_tree_id`, `corrected_data` precedence, only-in-A/B, summary counts); `CreateExtractIterationMutationTestCase` covers all three axes, the unknown-axis error path, and the auto-incrementing default name; `CompareExtractsResolverTestCase` smoke-tests the GraphQL resolver end-to-end. Respects the `Document.version_tree_id` unique constraint by demoting `is_current` before creating successor versions.
  - **E2E coverage — `frontend/tests/e2e/extract-pdf-workflow.spec.ts`** — extends the existing pipeline spec with `forkExtractIterationViaUI` + `selectIterationsForCompare` helpers (in `frontend/tests/e2e/helpers.ts`) to drive the `Iterations` tab end-to-end after the parent extract finishes: opens `NewIterationDialog`, picks the MODEL axis, names the iteration, submits with `Run immediately` OFF (the cassette only covers parent-extract LLM calls — see helper docstring), and asserts the new row renders with its axis chip. Then selects parent + new iteration to load `ExtractCompareView`, asserting the summary chips show `Only in A: 2 / Changed: 0 / 2 cells compared` and the heatmap header includes the column name. Proves `createExtractIteration → fullIterationList → compareExtracts` end-to-end without burning a second LLM round-trip.

- **VCR.py wrapper for LLM calls in `doc_extract_query_task`** — `opencontractserver/utils/vcr_replay.py` exposes a `maybe_vcr_cassette()` context manager that, when `OC_LLM_VCR_MODE` and `OC_LLM_VCR_CASSETTE` are set on the celery worker, records or replays every HTTP call to LLM provider hosts (currently `api.openai.com` / `api.anthropic.com`). A custom request-body matcher strips volatile values (millisecond timestamps, Django document PKs, OpenAI tool-call IDs, UUIDs) so a cassette recorded against one DB replays cleanly against another. With the env vars unset the wrapper is a no-op — production behavior is unchanged. Pre-recorded cassette for the E2E extract spec lives at `opencontractserver/tests/fixtures/cassettes/e2e_extract_pdf_workflow/extract.yaml`. Replay was verified end-to-end against a deliberately-fake `OPENAI_API_KEY` to confirm no real network call is made. See `docs/development/e2e_vcr.md` for record / replay / debug instructions.
- **`.github/workflows/frontend-e2e-extract.yml`** — CI workflow that runs the E2E extract spec against the full `local.yml` stack with `OC_LLM_VCR_MODE=replay` and a fake `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Triggered on `pull_request` (path-filtered to changes that can affect extract behaviour) in addition to `workflow_dispatch`. PDF parsing routes to the in-stack Docling microservice (`PDF_PARSER=docling`); the workflow forces `PipelineSettings.preferred_parsers["application/pdf"]` to Docling explicitly after `migrate` so a pre-existing DB singleton can't silently route through LlamaParse. No external service credentials required.
- **`frontend/tests/e2e/extract-pdf-workflow.spec.ts`** — full-stack Playwright E2E spec for the extract pipeline: login → create corpus → upload two PDFs (`frontend/tests/fixtures/{usc-title-1,eton-agreement}.pdf`) → wait for parse + embedding → create extract with one column → run with a real OpenAI call → CSV export → assert non-empty cells. Adds new helpers to `frontend/tests/e2e/helpers.ts` (`uploadPdfViaUI`, `waitForDocumentReady`, `createExtractViaUI`, `openExtractByName`, `addColumnViaUI`, `addDocumentsToExtractViaUI`, `runExtractAndWaitForFinish`). Gated on `E2E_RUN_LLM_TESTS=true`; skipped in CI until LLM responses can be mocked over the wire. Runs on the live `local.yml` stack; required tweaks to disable Auth0 (`.envs/.local/.django USE_AUTH0=false`) and to widen the celeryworker `watchfiles --ignore-paths` (in `compose/local/django/celery/worker/start` and the `local.yml` command pointer) so editor / Playwright artifact writes don't hot-reload the worker mid-task. Also adds `data-testid="document-card"` (+ `data-processing` on the `/documents`-view variants) to `frontend/src/views/Documents.tsx` and `data-testid="document-card"` to `frontend/src/components/documents/ModernDocumentItem.tsx`, so tests can poll for the `backendLock` UI signal without depending on hover-only action menus. Cards are matched by `[data-testid="document-card"]` filtered with the visible title text — the standard Playwright pattern.
- **Mypy: type analyzer, shared, agents, badges, worker_uploads; introduce shared protocols** (Issue #1335): Brought the five smaller, interface-rich target packages over the ≥70% return-annotation bar called for by the issue and seeded `opencontractserver/types/protocols.py` with the four protocols requested in the scope:
  - `VectorStoreProtocol` — minimum surface (`search` / `async_search`) implemented by `CoreAnnotationVectorStore` (`opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/core_vector_stores.py`); imported and re-exported from that module so consumers can annotate against the protocol rather than the concrete dataclass.
  - `PipelineComponentProtocol` — `title` / `description` / `author` / `dependencies` surface that the pipeline registry duck-types against; imported from `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/base_component.py` so any future parser/embedder/thumbnailer registered outside the inheritance hierarchy still type-checks against the same contract.
  - `ToolProtocol` — `name` / `description` / `parameters` / `requires_approval` mirror of `CoreTool` (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_factory.py`); framework adapters can accept any object satisfying it, no inheritance required.
  - `PermissionedQueryManagerProtocol` — `visible_to_user(user) -> QuerySet` contract that `BaseVisibilityManager`, `PermissionManager`, `DocumentManager`, `AnnotationManager`, and `NoteManager` all satisfy (`opencontractserver/shared/Managers.py`); imported there so callers receiving "a permissioned manager" can type against the protocol instead of a concrete class.
  - `StreamObserverProtocol` — duplicated `__call__(event)` shape from `opencontractserver/llms/types.StreamObserver` for callers in non-LLM modules (notifications, websockets) that need the contract without importing `llms.types`.
  - **Coverage delta** (return-annotation coverage measured by AST walk, excluding `__init__.py`):
    - `analyzer/`: 12.5% → **87.5%** (target ≥70%)
    - `shared/`: 38.1% → **96.3%** (target ≥70%)
    - `agents/`: 34.4% → **71.9%** (target ≥70%)
    - `badges/`: 47.1% → **100%** (target ≥70%)
    - `worker_uploads/`: 46.4% → **100%** (target ≥70%)
  - **Files touched** (annotations only, zero behavior changes): `analyzer/{apps,checks,signals,startup,utils,admin,admin_views}.py`, `analyzer/management/commands/sync_doc_analyzers.py`, `agents/{apps,admin,memory}.py`, `badges/{apps,signals,models}.py`, `worker_uploads/{apps,auth,serializers,views,models,tasks}.py`, `shared/{utils,defaults,fields,mixins,Managers,QuerySets,decorators}.py`, plus the four protocol-consumer wirings above.
  - **Bare-generic promotion**: every `dict` / `list` / `set` in newly-touched public signatures was widened to a parametrised form (`dict[str, Any]`, `list[Any]`, `dict[str, int]`, etc.). The `HasEmbeddingMixin` docstring example was tightened to match (`-> dict[str, Any]`).
  - **`# type: ignore` audit**: every bare `# type: ignore` comment in the codebase now carries a specific error code. `opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools.py:413,416,418,420` (channels/asgiref import + `partial` kwarg-aware wrapper) tightened to `[import-not-found]` / `[call-arg]` with a one-line comment explaining why; `opencontractserver/utils/embeddings.py:171` to `[attr-defined]`; `opencontractserver/tests/test_pipeline_utils.py:395,423,431,438,446` cleaned up the duplicated `# type: ignore; type: ignore` markers and scoped them to `[import-not-found]`; `opencontractserver/tests/test_core_tool_factory.py:34,35,47` widened from bare to `[attr-defined]`. The total count went from 62 → 61, and the ratio of bare-to-scoped dropped to zero.
- **Return-type annotations across `config/graphql/` resolvers and mutations** (Issue #1332, follow-up to #1331): The largest, least-typed subtree in the backend (459 function definitions, ~4.4% return-annotation coverage at baseline) is now at 100% return-annotation coverage. Touched files include every `*_mutations.py`, every `*_queries.py`, every `*_types.py`, plus `filters.py`, `base.py`, `base_types.py`, `security.py`, `optimized_file_resolvers.py`, `permissioning/permission_annotator/{middleware,mixins,utils}.py`, and the small utility modules. No behavioral changes — annotations only.
  - **`mutate(...)` on `graphene.Mutation` subclasses**: typed as forward references to the enclosing class (`-> "ClassName"`). Discovered and fixed the latent bug in `config/graphql/analysis_mutations.py:179` (`DeleteAnalysisMutation.mutate`) where the success path had no `return` statement; annotation is `-> "DeleteAnalysisMutation | None"` and an explicit `return None` was added to preserve the original implicit-None behavior on success.
  - **`resolve_*` methods**: typed as `-> Any` by default, refined where the GraphQL field type makes the runtime return obvious (e.g. `resolve_in_use -> bool`, `resolve_datacell_count -> int`).
  - **`AnnotatePermissionsForReadMixin`** (`config/graphql/permissioning/permission_annotator/mixins.py`): per the issue's specific guidance, `resolve_my_permissions -> list[str]`, `resolve_is_published -> bool`, `resolve_object_shared_with -> list[dict[str, Any]]`. The pre-existing wrong annotation `list[PermissionTypes]` (an Enum, while the implementation returns plain strings) was corrected to `list[str]`. The now-unused `PermissionTypes` import was removed.
  - **Filter / queryset helpers** (`filter_by_*`, `text_search_method`, `get_node`, `get_queryset`, `_get_*`, etc.) typed as `-> Any` to keep the change conservative; tightening to `QuerySet[Model]` is a follow-up.
  - **`config/graphql/permissioning/permission_annotator/utils.py`** had a broken import (`config.graphql.permission_annotator.middleware` instead of `config.graphql.permissioning.permission_annotator.middleware`) — fixed in passing.
  - **`config/graphql/conversation_types.py`**: replaced `base64.binascii.Error` with a direct `binascii.Error` import (pre-existing — `base64` re-exports `binascii` at runtime but `mypy` doesn't see the re-export).
  - **Var-annotated additions**: `id_to_children: dict[Any, list[Any]]` in `base_types.py`, `read_only_fields: list[str]` in `serializers.py`, `this_model_permission_id_map: dict[int, str]` etc. in middleware.
  - **Five modules graduated from the mypy baseline** (`mypy.ini` → no longer `ignore_errors = True`): `config.graphql.base_types`, `config.graphql.conversation_types`, `config.graphql.permissioning.permission_annotator.middleware`, `config.graphql.permissioning.permission_annotator.utils`, `config.graphql.serializers`. Their entries in `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt` (11 lines) were also pruned. Future PRs can graduate the remaining baselined files as the structural issues they expose (custom `visible_to_user` manager method not seen by `django-stubs`, `set_permissions_for_obj_to_user` signature mismatch, mixin `_meta` access) are addressed.
  - **Tooling**: zero new `# type: ignore` markers; black & isort applied; `flake8 config/graphql/` clean. `mypy --config-file mypy.ini opencontractserver config` passes with the updated baseline.
- **Mypy: graduated `opencontractserver/users/tasks.py` out of the baseline** (Issue #1333 follow-up): `tasks.py` was the last `opencontractserver.users` module still suppressed in `mypy.ini`. PR #1370 left it untyped because the file is only loaded when `settings.USE_AUTH0=True`, so it never failed at runtime under the test settings; the typing gap kept the package short of the issue's "all four packages at ≥80% return-annotation coverage" Done-When criterion. Added return + parameter annotations to all five Auth0 sync tasks (`get_new_auth0_token`, `apply_data_to_user`, `sync_remote_user`, `ensure_valid_auth0_token`, `get_user_details_async`), introduced a module-level docstring documenting the `USE_AUTH0` gating, and removed the `[mypy-opencontractserver.users.tasks] ignore_errors = True` section. Local `data` rebound from request body (`dict[str, str]`) to response payload (`dict[str, Any]`) was split into two distinctly-named variables (`request_data` / `payload`) so the types are unambiguous; behavior is unchanged. No callers needed updating — `config/graphql_auth0_auth/utils.py` still consumes `sync_remote_user.delay(...)` exactly as before.

### Fixed

- **Structured extraction agent loops on tool calls instead of committing** (Issue #1414, follow-up to #1381 / #1413): The E2E spec from PR #1413 surfaced a real `failure_mode=no_final_response` (the classifier added by PR #1399). With `gpt-4o-mini`, a strict prompt ("verbatim title from page 1"), and a 9-page PDF, the agent received the answer in its very first `load_document_text(start=0, end=500)` call and then made **97 more sequential 500-byte byte-range reads** through the entire body without ever calling `final_result*`. The structured runner exhausted `output_retries=3` and returned `None`. Two underlying biases were addressed in the structured-extraction system prompts:
  - **Tool-loop without commit** — the agent had the answer but treated reading as the entire task. The `2-3 distinct search queries` rule (added in #1381) was worded as an unconditional precondition to committing, which encouraged exhaustive reading whenever the prompt was constrained. All three `_build_structured_system_prompt` overrides in `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py` (`PydanticAICoreAgent`, `PydanticAIDocumentAgent`, `PydanticAICorpusAgent`) now lead with a **COMMIT-EARLY rule**: as soon as a tool result contains a confident answer, the agent MUST stop calling tools and commit by calling the result tool. The 2-3-search rule is now explicitly **negative-case-only** — it bounds giving up, not committing — and rule precedence is stated inline so the model can't conflate the two.
  - **Tool selection bias** — for prompts that map cleanly onto pre-chunked, embedded structural annotations (titles, parties, defined terms, specific clauses), the agent skipped `similarity_search` entirely and went straight to byte-range reads. The same prompt overrides now state that `similarity_search` is the **preferred first step** for fact-finding queries because the search index is already chunked and ranked over structural annotations, and reserve `load_document_text` (and other byte-range readers) for whole-document tasks (summaries, exhaustive review) or as a fallback when search clearly misses. The corpus override carries the matching guidance for document-coordination tools.
  - **Tests** — `opencontractserver/tests/test_pydantic_ai_agents.py` extended: `test_document_agent_structured_prompt_commits_to_result`, `test_corpus_agent_structured_prompt_commits_to_result`, and `test_core_agent_base_structured_prompt_commits_to_result` now assert on the new `COMMIT-EARLY` and `similarity_search` / `load_document_text` guidance, and the base-agent test asserts that the old unconditional "Before concluding the requested information is absent, you MUST issue at least 2-3 distinct search queries…" wording is **gone** — that exact phrasing is what produced the loop in #1414.
  - **Out of scope** — no model-side changes (no temperature override, no `output_retries` change), no rework of the structural-annotation similarity index. The classifier from #1381 / #1399 still surfaces any residual `no_final_response` if the model continues to loop on a different prompt shape.
  - **End-to-end verification (PR follow-up)** — re-recorded `opencontractserver/tests/fixtures/cassettes/e2e_extract_pdf_workflow/extract.yaml` against the new prompt with the in-stack Docling parser, then replayed the spec from PR #1413 cassette-only. The originally-failing USC cell now produces `"TITLE 1-GENERAL PROVISIONS"` (body text from page 1) and the Eton cell commits its description fallback — both non-empty. The cassette has 13 OpenAI interactions and contains zero occurrences of the old `Before concluding the requested information is absent…` wording, confirming the prompt the agent was asked under is the new one.
  - **VCR matcher hardening (`opencontractserver/utils/vcr_replay.py`)** — required for the re-record to replay against fresh DBs. (1) Strip Django auto-increment PKs (`annotation_id` / `corpus_id` / `document_id` / `label_id` / generic `id`) from request bodies; PKs are echoed back into subsequent assistant calls inside JSON-encoded tool messages, so the patterns match both the raw-JSON form and the escaped-string form (`\"annotation_id\\":N`). (2) Strip `similarity_score` / `score` floats — the embedder microservice and pgvector hybrid-search fusion produce slightly different numeric scores even for identical inputs across runs. (3) Replay drops body matching entirely — `record_mode="none"` now matches on `(method, scheme, host, port, path)` only and plays interactions back in cassette order. The vector-embedder microservice is real (not cassette-wrapped because it is not an LLM provider) and returns slightly different similarity orderings against a fresh corpus, which leaks chunk content into subsequent request bodies that no static stripper can normalize. Sequential playback is sufficient because the celery worker processes datacells sequentially, the model is effectively deterministic at the temperatures used, and the cassette captures the full successful conversation per document. Record mode keeps strict body matching so partial re-records still produce a deterministic cassette. New unit tests in `opencontractserver/tests/test_vcr_replay.py` cover the PK stripper (raw + escaped forms) and the similarity-score stripper.
  - **CI activation (`.github/workflows/frontend-e2e-extract.yml`)** — flipped from `workflow_dispatch`-only to `pull_request` (path-filtered to changes that can affect the extract agent or the cassette / matcher / spec). Forces `PDF_PARSER=docling` and explicitly resets `PipelineSettings.preferred_parsers` to Docling after `migrate` so a stale DB singleton can't silently route through LlamaParse. No external service credentials needed.
  - **Test-helper fixes for `frontend/tests/e2e/helpers.ts`** uncovered while replaying the spec end-to-end:
    - `addDocumentsToExtractViaUI` no longer hard-fails when the "Add documents" modal renders zero cards — the corpus auto-populates extract rows on creation, so the second `addDocuments` call legitimately has nothing to add. Probes for cards with a short timeout and bails to "Cancel" on the empty-modal path.
    - `runExtractAndWaitForFinish` now waits for the AG-Grid `Loading…` placeholder to detach after the "Extraction in progress" overlay clears. Previously the helper returned as soon as the backend marked the Extract row complete, but the per-cell `data` payloads were still mid-flight via Apollo, which made cell-text assertions intermittently see whitespace. Source of the "row has no non-empty extracted cell" false-negative when the spec was first re-run.
    - `waitForDocumentReady` no longer gates on the outer "Your documents" page heading. The route can render the document-card grid before its surrounding chrome (the heading lives in an outer layout component that occasionally hydrates last); the helper now waits directly on the document card it cares about with an inner 30s ceiling, since the card is a sufficient signal that the documents view loaded. Source of an intermittent 8-minute hang on `/documents` re-navigation.
- **Anthropic models silently fail in `doc_extract_query_task`** (Issue #1381): When `doc_extract_query_task` was run with an Anthropic / Claude model, ~85% of cells failed with the canonical "extraction returned None — the requested information may not be present" message even though the document contained the answer. Inspecting `Datacell.llm_call_log` for failed cells showed Claude's last assistant message was always `text` + `tool_use` parts, never a final structured response — pydantic-ai's structured-response runner treated this as no result and returned `None`. The error message conflated three distinct outcomes ("agent committed to None", "agent never produced a final structured response", "agent looped on the same tool call") under one ambiguous string. Three coordinated changes:
  - **`opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`** — All three `_build_structured_system_prompt` overrides (`PydanticAICoreAgent`, `PydanticAIDocumentAgent`, `PydanticAICorpusAgent`) now explicitly tell the agent that **after gathering enough information from the tools, it MUST commit to the final structured response by calling the result tool**. Wording is universal — harmless for OpenAI and necessary for Claude. `_structured_response_raw` now passes `output_retries=STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_RETRIES` (=3) to `PydanticAIAgent` so pydantic-ai retries the final-result tool call when the model fails to commit on the first pass. When an Anthropic model is used and the caller did not pin a temperature, structured runs force `temperature=0` (Claude is reluctant to commit; non-zero temperature pushes it toward more exploratory text). **Cost note**: bumping `output_retries` from pydantic-ai's default of 1 to 3 means a cell that fails the first commit attempt can incur up to 3 result-tool round trips. In the previous behaviour those cells silently returned `None` instead of retrying, so the worst-case per-cell LLM cost on Anthropic models can roughly triple compared to the broken baseline. This is the correct tradeoff — the previous baseline produced no answer — but operators should anticipate the cost shift in billing for Anthropic-driven extractions.
  - **`opencontractserver/constants/llm.py`** — Hosts `STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_RETRIES`, `TOOL_LOOP_THRESHOLD`, `EXTRACT_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE`, and the `NONE_RESULT_*` vocabulary used by the classifier (see below).
  - **`opencontractserver/utils/llm.py`** — New `is_anthropic_model()` helper so call sites outside the agents layer (notably `data_extract_tasks.doc_extract_query_task`) can decide whether to pass `temperature=None` and let the Anthropic guard activate.
  - **`opencontractserver/tasks/data_extract_tasks.py`** — New `_classify_none_result(messages)` helper inspects the captured pydantic-ai message log and returns one of `agent_committed_none` (a `final_result*` tool call appears — legitimate "data not present"), `no_final_response` (no `final_result*` anywhere — pipeline integration failure), `tool_loop_no_output` (same tool call repeated ≥ `TOOL_LOOP_THRESHOLD`× without final — pipeline bug), or `unknown`. The `Datacell.stacktrace` now records `failure_mode=<classification>` plus a human-readable message (the integration-failure variants reference issue #1381) so operators can `grep failure_mode=` to separate legitimate "not present" outcomes from pipeline bugs. New `_resolve_extract_temperature(model_name)` helper picks the temperature passed to the structured runner: returns `None` for Anthropic models so `_structured_response_raw`'s `temperature=0` override fires automatically, and `EXTRACT_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE` (0.3) otherwise. This closes the latent footgun where flipping `DEFAULT_EXTRACT_MODEL` to a Claude model would have silently bypassed the reliability fix because `temperature=EXTRACT_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE` was passed unconditionally.
  - **`opencontractserver/tests/test_data_extract_failure_classification.py`** — `SimpleTestCase` suite covering the classifier (empty input, `final_result` detection, `final_result_<TypeName>` suffix variants, no-tool-calls path, tool-call-without-final path, repeated-call loop detection, threshold-minus-one boundary, loop-then-commit precedence, mixed text + tool path, non-`ModelResponse` skip, JSON-string `args` normalisation, malformed JSON `args` defensive path, unhashable `args` `repr` fallback), `is_anthropic_model` (prefix, bare-name, OpenAI / `gpt-4` / `o1` rejection, empty/None), and `_resolve_extract_temperature` (Anthropic→None, OpenAI→default, unknown→default, current-default sanity check).
  - **`opencontractserver/tests/test_pydantic_ai_agents.py`** — New `_structured_response_raw` tests pinning the Anthropic temperature override (forces 0 when caller passes `temperature=None`, respects function-level pin, respects `config.temperature` pin, leaves OpenAI runs untouched), and three smoke tests for the strengthened `_build_structured_system_prompt` overrides covering the document, corpus, and core base agents.
- **Extraction grounding follow-up** (Issue #1246, follow-up to original #1245 grounding pipeline):
  - **Bug — silent `page=1` fallback corrupted multi-page PDF grounding** (`opencontractserver/utils/extraction_grounding.py`, `_create_pdf_annotation`): when PlasmaPDF could not determine a page for a span, the previous code logged a warning and saved the annotation on page 1 anyway. For multi-page PDFs this produced a structurally incorrect annotation pinned to the wrong page (and therefore the wrong bounding box context), so users clicking through to the source landed on a different page than the one containing the extracted text. Fixed: `_create_pdf_annotation` now raises `ValueError` inside its `transaction.atomic()` savepoint, the savepoint rolls back, and the outer per-result `try/except` in `_create_grounding_annotations` logs it as a failed grounding attempt. Best-effort grounding is preserved (other annotations in the batch are unaffected) but no annotation is ever saved with a wrong page.
  - **Bug — label-set lookup outside the per-annotation guard caused all-or-nothing failure** (`opencontractserver/utils/extraction_grounding.py`, `_create_grounding_annotations`): `corpus.ensure_label_and_labelset(...)` was invoked once before the per-annotation `try/with transaction.atomic()` loop. A failure to materialise the label-set (e.g. a transient DB error or a pre-existing constraint conflict) propagated out, was caught by the outer `try/except` in `data_extract_tasks.py`, and silently dropped _all_ groundings for the datacell. Moved the call inside the savepoint so a label-lookup failure only skips the affected annotation.
  - **Bug — duplicate `OC_EXTRACT_SOURCE` annotations on Celery retry** (`opencontractserver/utils/extraction_grounding.py`, `_create_pdf_annotation` & `_create_span_annotation`): nothing prevented the grounding pipeline from creating fresh annotations and re-linking them via `datacell.sources.add(*annotations)` if `ground_extraction_to_annotations` ran twice on the same datacell (Celery retry after partial failure was the realistic trigger). Replaced the construct-then-`save()` flow with `Annotation.objects.get_or_create()` keyed on `(document, annotation_label, annotation_type, raw_text, …)` so retries reuse existing rows. `datacell.sources` is a `ManyToManyField`, so re-linking the same row is already a no-op once the row is shared.
  - **Constant — extracted `DOCX_MIME_TYPE`** (`opencontractserver/constants/document_processing.py`): the long `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` literal previously lived inline in `_load_document_text_and_layer`. Per the project's no-magic-strings rule it now sits next to `MARKDOWN_MIME_TYPE` and is imported from one place.
  - **Type annotations** (`opencontractserver/utils/extraction_grounding.py`): `Document`, `Corpus`, `Datacell`, `Annotation`, and `AnnotationLabel` parameters and return types added via a `TYPE_CHECKING` block on every public and helper function. No runtime change.
  - **Documentation** — the `page=1` placeholder for SPAN_LABEL annotations (text/DOCX) is now documented in the function docstring, explaining that the `txt_extract_file` pipeline does not preserve a page-break map and the actual location lives in the character offsets in `json`.
  - **Tests** — `opencontractserver/tests/test_extraction_grounding.py`:
    - `TestGroundingPipelinePDFIntegration` (new class): builds a synthetic two-page PAWLS payload (no real PDF binary needed), runs grounding through `build_translation_layer`, and verifies (a) annotations land on the correct page, (b) re-running grounding is idempotent, and (c) when PlasmaPDF returns `page=None` the annotation is **skipped** instead of being saved on page 1.
    - `test_ground_text_document_is_idempotent`: regression for the duplicate-annotation bug on the SPAN_LABEL path.
- **`CreateCorpusActionModal` opened with the wrong default agent instructions for document triggers** (Issue #1385, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CreateCorpusActionModal.tsx:136-144,168-171`): the `inlineAgentInstructions` state was initialised with `DEFAULT_MODERATOR_INSTRUCTIONS` even though the default trigger is `add_document` (a document trigger). The trigger-change handler at line 611 swaps to `DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS`, but a user who created an inline agent on the default-selected trigger without first re-selecting the trigger would submit the moderator copy as the new agent's system instructions. Initialised both the `useState` default and `resetForm()` to `DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS` so the pre-interaction value matches the default trigger. Updated `frontend/tests/CreateCorpusActionModal.ct.tsx` "inline-agent create: full happy path" mutation mock to expect `DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS` — the previous mock variable masked this bug because `MockedProvider` was matching the stale moderator default rather than the trigger-appropriate one.

### Changed

- **Test/type cleanup follow-ups from the PR #1383 review** (Issue #1385):

  - Pinned the `isProcessing` contract for SYNC_CONTENT in `frontend/tests/CorpusChat.ct.tsx` "SYNC_CONTENT renders a complete message immediately": added an `expect(input).toBeEnabled()` assertion after the reply renders, locking the documented invariant that `setIsProcessing(true)` is owned solely by `ASYNC_START` and that a SYNC_CONTENT-only reply must never disable the input.
  - Consolidated the duplicated `::: oc-component` fence dispatcher: extracted `OcComponentBlock` interface and a new `buildOcComponentCustomBlocks(renderMarkdown)` helper into `frontend/src/utils/camlComponents.ts`. Both `frontend/src/hooks/useCamlComponentRenderer.tsx` and `frontend/src/components/corpuses/caml/CamlDirectiveRenderer.tsx` now share the same helper instead of each casting `block` independently.
  - Replaced `route: any` and `page: any` escape hatches with the proper `Route` and `Page` types from `@playwright/test` in `frontend/tests/CorpusDescriptionEditor.ct.tsx` (`setupMdRoute` and the abort-route test).
  - Migrated `.version-number` CSS-class locators in `frontend/tests/CorpusDescriptionEditor.ct.tsx` to a semantic `data-testid="version-number"` matcher (`page.getByTestId("version-number")`); added the test id to the rendered version-row in `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusDescriptionEditor.tsx`.

- **`test_superuser_sees_all_queryset` miscounts personal corpuses by 1** (Issue #1394, `opencontractserver/tests/test_visibility_managers.py`, `opencontractserver/tests/test_resolvers.py`): Two `VisibleToUserTests.test_superuser_sees_all_queryset` cases asserted that `Corpus.objects.visible_to_user(superuser).count() == 4` (public + private + 2 personal), but the actual count is 5 because the test DB starts with a pre-existing personal corpus owned by django-guardian's `AnonymousUser` (created during fixture setup before/around the username-based skip in `opencontractserver/users/signals.py::user_created_signal`). The assertion is now scoped to corpuses created by the test's two users (`creator__in=[self.user, self.superuser]`), making it resilient to any fixture-level corpuses that exist at test DB init time. Production code is unchanged.
- **Merged `frontend` Codecov flag drops to ~33% on every commit where Frontend CI's CT job fails** (`frontend/package.json` `test:coverage:ct`): the script chained `playwright test ... && mkdir -p ... && nyc report ...`, so a failing CT run short-circuited before `nyc report` could turn the per-test JSON files in `.nyc_output` into an `lcov.info`. The downstream `Upload CT Coverage to Codecov` step (`if: success() || failure()`) then errored with "No coverage reports found" and `frontend-component` did not upload for that SHA. Codecov's server-side aggregation of the `frontend` flag was left with only `frontend-unit` (~23%) and `frontend-e2e` (~24%), pulling the merged number down to ~33% even though the previous commit was at ~67% — observed on six consecutive main commits 2026-04-26T01:02..02:58Z (`2d7033f8`..`be5bcfc8`) before recovering on `30298391`. Mirrored the existing `test:e2e:coverage` pattern (`; CT_EXIT=$?; nyc report ... || echo "No coverage data to report"; exit $CT_EXIT`) so `nyc report` runs regardless of test outcome and the lcov ships even on red CT runs. `frontend-component` will still report a slightly lower number when tests fail (failed tests register fewer hits), but it will report — keeping the merged `frontend` flag's denominator stable.
- **`User.__init__` shared-state mutation re-introduced by branch merge** (`opencontractserver/users/models.py:172-180` removed): PR #1374 (commit `50ed6740`) deleted the `User.__init__` override that mutated `Field.validators[0]` on every instantiation, but a subsequent merge (`b68c1cb4 → 6d2cddbf`) resurrected the override along with its mypy-narrowing changes. The current main on commit `6d2cddbf` therefore reproduced the original `#1358` bug: `User(...)` rebound `username_field.validators[0]` and clobbered any third-party validator prepended to the list. Removed the `__init__` override entirely; the class-body declaration `validators=[UserUnicodeUsernameValidator()]` on the `username` field (still present from PR #1374) is the canonical and only declaration. Also dropped the now-unused `Field` import. Regression coverage from PR #1374 (`opencontractserver/tests/test_user_username_validator.py`) was already on main and is what surfaced the regression in CI.
- **Decomposed `opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools.py` into a package** (Issue #1445): The 2,981-line monolith has been split into the `opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools/` package with one submodule per tool category — `md_summaries`, `notes`, `text_extracts`, `descriptions`, `document_summaries`, `annotations`, `document_indexing`, `search`, `page_images`, `links`, `documents`, `memory`, plus a private `_helpers` for shared utilities (`_token_count`, `_db_sync_to_async`, `_apply_ndiff_patch`). The package's `__init__.py` re-exports every previously top-level name (functions, classes, `_DOC_TXT_CACHE`, and the `Document`/`Note`/`Corpus`/`CorpusDescriptionRevision`/`NoteRevision` model references that tests patch directly), so no consumer import paths change. Behavior-preserving — each function body is identical to the original; this is purely a structural refactor to make individual tool families reviewable in isolation. Documentation references in `docs/architecture/pawls-format.md`, `docs/architecture/document_annotation_index.md`, `docs/architecture/llms/README.md`, `docs/walkthrough/step-7-query-corpus.md`, and the `opencontractserver/corpuses/template_seeds.py` comment were updated to point at the new package paths.

### Security

- **`RemoveAnnotationLabelsFromLabelsetMutation` allowed any user to strip labels from public labelsets** (`config/graphql/label_mutations.py`): The resolver used `Q(creator=user) | Q(is_public=True)` with no further check, so `is_public` (a read flag) effectively granted write access to non-owners. Replaced with `user_has_permission_for_obj(user, labelset, PermissionTypes.UPDATE, include_group_permissions=True)`. Denial raises `LabelSet.DoesNotExist` so the response is byte-identical to the not-found case (no IDOR information leak). Coverage: `test_remove_labels_rejects_non_owner_even_when_labelset_is_public`.
- **`CreateLabelForLabelsetMutation` ignored guardian UPDATE grants** (`config/graphql/label_mutations.py`): The resolver was creator-only, so collaborators with explicit `update_labelset` guardian permission (or a group grant) could not add labels even though the consolidated permissioning guide says edit rights on a `LabelSet` should permit add/remove/edit of its labels. Now uses the same `PermissionTypes.UPDATE` gate as `Remove`, with the matching IDOR-safe deny path. Coverage: `test_non_owner_with_explicit_update_permission_can_create`. Both mutations now have a dedicated `LabelSet.DoesNotExist` handler that logs at WARNING (not ERROR) so auth probes don't pollute logs with stack traces.
- **Cross-corpus structural-annotation leak in `CoreAnnotationVectorStore`** (`opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/core_vector_stores.py:296-326,371-413`): The corpus-wide retrieval path (`corpus_id` set, `document_id=None`) returned every structural annotation in the database regardless of corpus. Two collaborating defects caused the leak:
  1. `Q(structural=True)` in the corpus-only branch had **no corpus constraint** — parser-produced structural annotations have `Annotation.document_id = corpus_id = NULL`, so corpus membership is only knowable through `structural_set → Document.structural_annotation_set (reverse FK) → DocumentPath.corpus_id`, a join the previous code did not perform.
  2. The `check_corpus_deletion` block (default `True`) added `Q(document_id__in=active_doc_ids)`, and `__in` lookups never match `NULL`, so structural annotations were silently dropped on the production-default path. Bypassing this filter with `check_corpus_deletion=False` exposed defect #1 directly.
  - **Impact**: Multi-tenant deployments leaked structural annotations across tenant corpora — a real security boundary violation since the upfront IDOR check only validated the _requested_ `corpus_id`, not the _returned_ rows. Single-tenant deployments saw it as a corpus-scoping / search-quality bug (e.g. corpus-wide benchmark runs returned chunks from abandoned corpora). The standard `Annotation.objects.visible_to_user()` permission filter was bypassed entirely because the vector store builds its own filter chain rather than going through that manager method.
  - **Fix** (corpus boundary + per-document visibility for the structural class): the corpus-only branch now requires `structural_set_id__in=<sets reachable from a document in this corpus that is visible to the user>`, joining through `Document.objects.visible_to_user(user).filter(path_records__corpus_id=...)`. The deletion-aware filter accepts both `document_id__in=active` AND structural rows whose set links to one of those active documents, so parser-produced structural annotations remain reachable on the default path. `CoreAnnotationVectorStore.global_search()` was already correct (it explicitly joins via `structural_set__documents__in=accessible_doc_ids`) and is unchanged.
  - Regression coverage: `opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_isolation_vector_store.py` — six tests covering cross-corpus leak, deletion-aware drop, orphan-set leak, document-scoped retrieval still returns structural rows, viewer-without-doc-permission excluded, creator still sees own row.
- **Test-only**: `opencontractserver/tests/test_pydantic_ai_agents.py`, `opencontractserver/tests/test_structural_annotation_portability.py` — `Document.objects.create(...)` calls in `TransactionTestCase` setUp now pass `processing_started=timezone.now()` to short-circuit `process_doc_on_create_atomic`, which would otherwise eagerly chain a Celery PDF-ingest task that fails on the (file-less) test document and aborts the whole test class. Pre-existing failure, exposed cleanly when the regression suite was added.

### Fixed

- **`Embedding.embedder_path` could be NULL but was typed `str`** (Issue #1357, `opencontractserver/annotations/models.py:461-465`, `opencontractserver/annotations/models.py:584-585`, `opencontractserver/annotations/migrations/0068_enforce_embedder_path_not_null.py`): The Django field was declared `null=True, blank=True` while the Python annotation claimed `str`, causing a long-standing mypy `assignment` error and — more importantly — silently gutting the partial unique constraints added in migration 0059. Each `unique_embedding_per_{document,annotation,note,conversation,message}_embedder` constraint is conditioned on `<parent>__isnull=False` and keys on `(embedder_path, <parent>)`, so any row with `embedder_path IS NULL` bypassed duplicate prevention for its parent. Every production code path that creates an `Embedding` (`Embedding.objects.store_embedding()`, `HasEmbeddingMixin.add_embedding()`, `worker_uploads._store_embeddings()`) already supplies a concrete `embedder_path` or skips creation when empty, so enforcing non-null at the DB level matches actual behaviour rather than constraining it. New migration 0068 backfills any legacy NULL rows with `settings.DEFAULT_EMBEDDER` (deleting rows that would collide with an existing `(default_embedder_path, parent)` row under the partial unique constraint — they were previously unreachable via any query path since all call sites filter on a concrete embedder path), then `AlterField`s the column to `NOT NULL`. Removed the now-unreachable `or 'Unknown Model'` fallback in `Embedding.__str__`. Migration runs with `atomic = False` so the RunPython backfill commits before `AlterField` takes the `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock to set `NOT NULL`, matching the pattern established by migration 0059.

### Added

- **Frontend `any`-baseline gate wired into CI** (Issue #1448): The frontend has no ESLint pipeline, so explicit `any` accretion was silent — ~449 type-position uses across 123 files at the time of this change. New script `frontend/scripts/check-any-baseline.js` walks `frontend/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, counts `: any | as any | <any> | any[] | Array<any> | Promise<any> | ReadonlyArray<any>` (skipping comment-only lines), and compares against the committed `frontend/.any-baseline.json` snapshot (total + per-area breakdown across `knowledge_base`, `annotator`, `widgets_chat`, `widgets_other`, `components_other`, `graphql`, `hooks`, `atoms`, `routing`, `utils`, `types`, `other`). New scripts: `yarn any:check` (regression-only), `yarn any:check:strict` (also fails when the count drops without the baseline being lowered, keeping the snapshot honest), `yarn any:write` (regenerate after a reduction). The Lint job in `.github/workflows/frontend.yml` runs `any:check:strict` on every PR. Workflow + rationale documented in `docs/frontend/any-baseline.md`. Per the issue, follow-up PRs are expected to drain the prioritised areas (`knowledge_base` 33 → … → 0, `annotator` 90 → …, `widgets_chat` 2 → 0) by replacing `any` with types from `frontend/src/types/graphql-api.ts` / GraphQL codegen output, calling out the per-area delta in each PR.
- **Pluggable text chunking strategies for `TxtParser`** (Issue #1348, alongside PR #1239): Introduced `opencontractserver/pipeline/parsers/text_chunkers.py` — a small registry-backed abstraction (`BaseTextChunker` + `TextChunk` + `get_chunker`) with three built-in strategies: `SentenceChunker` (spaCy `doc.sents`, preserves pre-#1348 behaviour and emits the existing `SENTENCE` label), `ParagraphChunker` (blank-line split with optional `min_chars` filter and `max_chars` oversize-paragraph fallback, emits `PARAGRAPH`), and `SlidingWindowChunker` (fixed-character window with configurable `overlap` and optional `respect_word_boundaries` snap, emits `WINDOW`). `TxtParser` now declares a `Settings` dataclass with a `chunkers: list[ChunkerSpec]` field (default `[{"name": "sentence"}]`) that can be overridden via `PipelineSettings` _or_ per-call via a `chunkers=[...]` kwarg on `parse_document`; the parser iterates the configured strategies and emits one structural SPAN_LABEL annotation per chunk under each strategy's label, so stacked configurations (e.g. sentence + paragraph) index multiple retrieval granularities simultaneously. Motivates the benchmark work in #1239: the LegalBench-RAG `probe_recall_at_10` gap on `privacy_qa` (0.22 observed vs 0.5–0.8 paper floor) is the thesis for needing paragraph-granularity retrieval units, but this PR is strategy-neutral — which chunker wins for which subset is a follow-up optimisation to be driven by the benchmark harness itself. Regression coverage in `opencontractserver/tests/test_text_chunkers.py` (pure-Python, no Django DB) exercises offset/whitespace invariants, overlap arithmetic, word-boundary snapping, argument validation and registry lookup; `test_txt_ingestor_pipeline.py` gains two integration tests that parse the live fixture with a paragraph-only and a stacked paragraph+sliding_window recipe. Existing sentence-only ingestion path is unchanged.
- **Global post-retrieval reranker for vector search** (Issue #1349): Adds an optional cross-encoder reranking stage that runs after first-stage vector / hybrid retrieval, so OpenContracts can close the gap between vanilla HNSW recall and the accuracy achievable with a cross-encoder scoring pass.
  - New abstract base class `opencontractserver.pipeline.base.reranker.BaseReranker` wired into the existing `PipelineComponentBase` settings machinery: concrete subclasses declare a `Settings` dataclass (loaded from `PipelineSettings` at runtime) and implement `_rerank_impl(query, passages, **kwargs)`. A default `_arerank_impl` wraps the sync implementation via `sync_to_async` so every backend has a working async path without duplicating logic.
  - Fault-tolerant helpers `safe_rerank` / `safe_arerank` swallow reranker failures and return `None` so retrieval degrades gracefully to the first-stage ordering — critical because a misconfigured reranker must never take down semantic search.
  - Four shipped backends in `opencontractserver/pipeline/rerankers/`:
    - `NoopReranker` — identity pass-through for tests and benchmark control conditions.
    - `CrossEncoderReranker` — in-process `sentence_transformers.CrossEncoder` (default `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` per the issue); lazy model load cached by `(model_name, device)` so workers pay the ~300 MB cost once and reuse it on every query. `sentence-transformers` / `torch` are treated as optional dependencies; a missing install surfaces a clear `ImportError` only when this backend is actually selected.
    - `MicroserviceReranker` — HTTP client that mirrors the shape of `MicroserviceEmbedder` (URL, optional API key, Cloud-Run IAM auth, retry-friendly timeouts). Operators can run any reranker model behind a `/rerank` endpoint and point OpenContracts at it via `RERANKER_MICROSERVICE_URL` (+ secret `RERANKER_MICROSERVICE_API_KEY`).
    - `CohereReranker` — hosted Rerank API (`rerank-v3.5` by default) via the REST endpoint directly (no hard dep on the `cohere` SDK). API key stored in the encrypted `PipelineSettings.encrypted_secrets` bag under `cohere_api_key` (env var `COHERE_API_KEY` at migration time).
  - New `ComponentType.RERANKER` enum value and `rerankers/` auto-discovery in `opencontractserver.pipeline.registry`; `PipelineComponentRegistry` now exposes `.rerankers` / `get_all_rerankers_cached()` alongside parsers, embedders, thumbnailers, and post-processors.
  - `PipelineSettings.default_reranker` (CharField, max_length=512, `documents/models.py:852-980`) — empty string disables reranking; any value is a full class path resolved at runtime. Seeded from `DEFAULT_RERANKER` Django setting at migration time (`documents/migrations/0037_add_default_reranker_to_pipeline_settings.py`). Helpers `get_default_reranker_path()` / `get_default_reranker_class()` / `get_default_reranker_instance()` in `opencontractserver.pipeline.utils`, with a process-local instance cache (cross-encoder model weights are expensive) invalidated via `invalidate_reranker_cache()` on every settings update.
  - `CoreAnnotationVectorStore` (`opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/core_vector_stores.py:120-1041`) now accepts an optional `reranker` override + `rerank_oversample_factor` kwarg. Every search path — `search`, `async_search`, `hybrid_search`, `async_hybrid_search`, `global_search`, `async_global_search` — oversamples candidates by `RERANK_OVERSAMPLE_FACTOR` (default 3× the requested `top_k`, hard-capped by `RERANK_MAX_CANDIDATES = 128`) when a reranker is active and re-orders results through `_apply_rerank` / `_aapply_rerank` before returning the final `top_k`. All new plumbing is a no-op when `default_reranker` is empty, so zero behavior change for existing deployments.
  - GraphQL surface: `PipelineComponentsType.rerankers`, `PipelineSettingsType.default_reranker`, and `UpdatePipelineSettingsMutation.default_reranker` (validated against the registry, invalidates the reranker instance cache on change).
  - New constants in `opencontractserver.constants.search`: `RERANK_OVERSAMPLE_FACTOR`, `RERANK_MAX_CANDIDATES`, `RERANK_DEFAULT_TOP_K`. New `RERANKER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in `opencontractserver.constants.document_processing`.
  - Tests in `opencontractserver/tests/test_reranker.py` cover the base-class contract (sorting, top_k trim, out-of-range indices, max-candidates, async fallback), `safe_rerank` / `safe_arerank` fault-tolerance, all three HTTP backends with mocked `requests.post`, pipeline utility resolution + instance caching, registry auto-discovery, and vector-store integration (oversample factor, reranker failure fallback, re-ordering effects).
- **Mypy graduation: typed GraphQL resolvers, mutations, and filters** (Issue #1332): Raised return-annotation coverage in `config/graphql/` from ~4.8% at the start of #1331 to **91.5%** (421/460 function defs) and removed 22 modules from the `mypy.ini` baseline allow-list.
  - **Root-cause annotation fixes in `opencontractserver/utils/permissioning.py`**: `set_permissions_for_obj_to_user`, `user_has_permission_for_obj`, `get_users_permissions_for_obj`, and `get_permission_id_to_name_map_for_model` were previously annotated with `instance: type[django.db.models.Model]` (a class) despite every call site passing an instance — and with `user: type[User]` instead of the `User` runtime instance. These were annotation bugs (the code was correct, the annotations were inverted), which compounded: every mutation calling `set_permissions_for_obj_to_user(user, obj, ...)` was a single `[arg-type]` error each. Corrected to `instance: django.db.models.Model` / `user: UserModel` (forward-referenced via `TYPE_CHECKING` import of `opencontractserver.users.models.User`). Also added the missing `dict[int, str]` annotation on `this_model_permission_id_map` and removed the `user_instance=User` (class) default on `get_users_group_ids`, which would have exploded at runtime if any caller ever omitted the argument. Module graduated out of the baseline.
  - **Graduated from `mypy.ini` baseline** (22 modules): `config.graphql.{action_queries, agent_mutations, badge_mutations, base_types, conversation_mutations, conversation_types, corpus_types, document_queries, filters, ingestion_source_mutations, moderation_mutations, og_metadata_queries, pipeline_queries, security, serializers, slug_queries, smart_label_mutations, social_types, user_queries, user_types, voting_mutations}` and `opencontractserver.utils.permissioning`. Each had the underlying mypy errors fixed first (root-cause in `permissioning.py` cleared the `set_permissions_for_obj_to_user` cluster across every mutation file above).
  - **Per-file type fixes**:
    - `config/graphql/slug_queries.py` & `config/graphql/user_types.py` & `config/graphql/social_types.py` & `config/graphql/corpus_types.py`: Reversed `.filter(...).visible_to_user(user)` → `.visible_to_user(user).filter(...)` so the custom manager method (typed on the manager) resolves before `.filter()` flattens to the base `QuerySet[Model]` that django-stubs doesn't know carries `visible_to_user`. Semantics are preserved — both orderings AND the conditions. The CLAUDE.md permissioning docs already recommend the manager-first pattern.
    - `config/graphql/og_metadata_queries.py`: Guarded against `Extract.corpus` being `None` (the FK uses `on_delete=SET_NULL`, so `corpus` is nullable in the DB but the OG metadata resolver was treating it as non-null).
    - `config/graphql/pipeline_queries.py`: Narrowed the `mimetype` optional before passing to `get_components_by_mimetype_cached` (which required `str`), and typed `components_data` as `dict[str, Sequence[PipelineComponentDefinition]]` so both branches (which return `list[...]` vs `tuple[...]`) type-check against the unified annotation.
    - `config/graphql/ingestion_source_mutations.py`: Replaced `if error:` with `if pk is None:` in two call sites — the error-then-continue pattern left mypy unable to narrow `pk: str | None` through the conditional. Functionally equivalent (`error is None ⟺ pk is not None` by construction of `_parse_ingestion_source_global_id`).
    - `config/graphql/conversation_types.py`: Fixed `base64.binascii.Error` → `binascii.Error` with an explicit `import binascii` — `base64` doesn't re-export `binascii` as an attribute, so the reference was broken under `warn_unused_ignores`.
    - `config/graphql/filters.py`: Coerced `from_global_id(value)[1]` (returns `str`) to `int` before passing to `folder_id` lookup.
    - `config/graphql/security.py`: Replaced `CsrfViewMiddleware(lambda req: None)` with a typed `_csrf_noop_get_response(request) -> HttpResponse` so the middleware's `get_response` contract is satisfied in-types; switched `wrapped_view.csrf_exempt = True` and `request._dont_enforce_csrf_checks = True` to `setattr(...)` to avoid typing-only attribute errors against Django stubs that don't carry these internal flags. Behaviour identical.
    - `config/graphql/moderation_mutations.py`: Added an explicit `Union[ChatMessage, Conversation, None]` annotation on `target` where the surrounding `if/else` mixes the two types (mypy can't unify across branches without the hint).
    - `config/graphql/action_queries.py`: Coerced `from_global_id(...)[1]` to `int` at the three call sites where it feeds `for_corpus` / `for_document` custom queryset methods (which expect `int` PKs).
  - **Docs & baseline maintenance**: `mypy.ini` baseline section for `config.graphql` trimmed from 35 modules to 14; 63 matching error lines pruned from `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt` so the reference file matches the live baseline.
  - **Known remaining bugs surfaced by mypy** (filed as separate issues per the scope rules of #1332):
    - #1359 — `RemoveLabelsFromLabelsetMutation` calls non-existent `labelset.documents`. Silent runtime failure (swallowed by a broad `except Exception`). Blocks `config.graphql.label_mutations` graduation; one-line fix + test needed.
    - #1360 — `DRFMutation.IOSettings` declares `model: django.db.models.Model = None` and `serializer = None`. Non-trivial refactor of the base mutation class; blocks `config.graphql.base` graduation.
- **Coverage: raise Corpus Chat & Agent Management component tests** (Issue #1276): added 36 new Playwright CT tests across the four lowest-ROI corpus components to drive coverage toward the ≥60% target. Breakdown:
  - `frontend/tests/CorpusChat.ct.tsx` (+13 tests): `initialQuery` auto-send, tool-call timeline entries (ASYNC_THOUGHT), ASYNC_SOURCES merge, SYNC_CONTENT rendering, ASYNC_RESUME, ask_document sub-tool approval remapping, unknown-type default branch, back-to-list navigation, server-message-with-sources rendering, title-filter debounce, and additional navigation-header coverage. Extended the shared `StubSocket` in `beforeEach` with new query-triggered frame sequences.
  - `frontend/tests/CreateCorpusActionModal.ct.tsx` (+8 tests): analyzer-path validation, inline-agent validation (empty name / empty instructions), existing-agent-selection validation, successful inline-agent mutation, backend error toast, analyzer edit-mode pre-population, and legacy trigger-casing normalization fallback.
  - `frontend/tests/CorpusAgentManagement.ct.tsx` (+8 tests): query loading state, query error state, multi-tool badge overflow, inactive-status badge, update-mutation happy path, create-mutation backend-error toast, tool deselection, and edit-modal cancel.
  - `frontend/tests/CorpusDescriptionEditor.ct.tsx` (+7 tests): save failure (`ok: false`), save network-error path, reapply of snapshot-less version, twice-click collapse, Cancel Version Edit reset, fetch-md URL failure, and version-count pluralization.
  - **Follow-up review polish**: moved `DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS` from `CreateCorpusActionModal.tsx` into `frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts` so both default-instruction strings (moderator + document agent) live in the single constants module per the project's no-magic-strings rule.
- **Return-type annotations across core models and import/export pipeline** (Issue #1334, follow-up to #1331): The mypy gate wired in by #1331 recorded a 7208-error baseline frozen across 357 files. This PR pays down the annotation deficit on the core domain models and the bulk import/export tasks without touching runtime behavior or adding validators. Coverage jumped from the pre-issue numbers to:
  - `opencontractserver/corpuses/` 61.5% → 88.4% (target ≥80%)
  - `opencontractserver/annotations/` 48.1% → 93.8% (target ≥80%)
  - `opencontractserver/documents/` 51.9% → 84.9% (target ≥80%)
  - `opencontractserver/extracts/` 47.1% → 94.1% (target ≥75%)
  - `tasks/import_tasks.py`, `tasks/import_tasks_v2.py`, `tasks/export_tasks.py`, `tasks/export_tasks_v2.py` all at 100% function-signature coverage.
  - **Files touched** (annotations only — zero behavior changes, zero new comments, zero renames): `annotations/{models,signals,admin}.py`, `corpuses/{models,signals,managers}.py`, `documents/{models,signals}.py`, `extracts/{models,signals}.py`, `tasks/{import_tasks,import_tasks_v2,export_tasks,export_tasks_v2}.py`.
  - Each file adopts `from __future__ import annotations` so forward references work without string quoting, and uses a `TYPE_CHECKING` block for the handful of cross-app imports (`AbstractBaseUser`, `Corpus`, `Document`, `Annotation`, etc.) that would otherwise be circular at runtime.
  - **TypedDict adoption** — the import/export task signatures now consume existing TypedDicts from `opencontractserver/types/dicts.py` directly instead of bare `dict`: `OpenContractsExportDataJsonPythonType` / `OpenContractsExportDataJsonV2Type` for the data.json payloads, `OpenContractDocExport` for per-document payloads, `OpenContractsAnnotationPythonType` / `OpenContractsRelationshipPythonType` for annotation/relationship lists, `IngestionSourceExport` / `DocumentPathExport` / `StructuralAnnotationSetExport` / `CorpusFolderExport` / `AgentConfigExport` / `DescriptionRevisionExport` / `ConversationExport` / `ChatMessageExport` / `MessageVoteExport` for V2-specific shapes, and `OpenContractsAnnotatedDocumentImportType` for single-document imports. No new TypedDicts were introduced — all were already defined and previously unused in callers.
  - Signal handlers (`annotations/signals.py`, `corpuses/signals.py`, `documents/signals.py`, `extracts/signals.py`) now have typed `sender` / `instance` / `created` / `**kwargs` parameters with `TYPE_CHECKING` imports of the sender model classes.
  - **Manager methods**: `CorpusActionExecutionManager.visible_to_user` now types the optional `user` param as `Optional[AbstractBaseUser]` (previously bare default), and `summary_by_status` / `summary_by_action` tightened from bare `dict` / `QuerySet` to `dict[str, int]` / `QuerySet[Any]`.
  - **Model method signatures**: `save()`/`clean()`/`delete()` overrides are now `-> None` (Django's `Model.save` returns None) or `-> tuple[int, dict[str, int]]` (Django's `Model.delete` signature); `__str__` returns `str`; `@property` accessors have explicit scalar returns; classmethod factories return `"ClassName"`; tree/versioning helpers on `CorpusFolder` type their descendant queries as `QuerySet[CorpusFolder]` / `list[CorpusFolder]` where applicable (falling back to `Any` where the CTE queryset class isn't easily importable).
  - **Graduation from the mypy baseline is deferred.** The `mypy.ini` `[mypy-…] ignore_errors = True` sections for these modules still contain pre-existing Django-plugin-specific errors (field descriptor `assignment` mismatches, `misc` lambdas in model field declarations, base-class variable override warnings on `embedder_path`/`creator`) that are not caused by missing annotations and therefore cannot be fixed under this issue's "annotations only, no bugfixes" constraint. The annotations landed here make those modules ready for a follow-up PR that either `# type: ignore`s or refactors the remaining Django-model type issues and then removes the baseline entries.
- **Mypy type-checking wired into pre-commit and CI** (Issue #1331): The existing `[mypy]` block in `setup.cfg` and the `mypy==1.20.1` / `django-stubs==6.0.2` / `djangorestframework-stubs==3.16.9` pins in `requirements/local.txt` were never actually enforced, so the investment was drifting (48 pre-existing `# type: ignore` markers, many modules at 0% annotation coverage). This PR turns on the gate without requiring the 7208 existing errors across 357 files to be fixed first — `mypy.ini` lists each of those files under its own `[mypy-<module>] ignore_errors = True` section, so new modules added outside the baseline **are** type-checked and CI / the hook fails on their errors.
  - `mypy.ini` (split out of `setup.cfg` because the per-module baseline is ~1000 lines): `python_version` bumped `3.9` → `3.11` to match the runtime, plugins kept, `django_settings_module` pointed at the new `config/settings/mypy.py` (dummy `DATABASE_URL` default so contributors don't need env vars).
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: new `mirrors-mypy@v1.20.1` hook with `pass_filenames: false` and fully pinned stubs + Django runtime in `additional_dependencies` (pre-commit autoupdate only bumps `rev`, so unpinned stubs would drift).
  - `.github/workflows/backend.yml`: `Run mypy` step added to the `linter` job; the preceding `pip install -r requirements/local.txt` step satisfies the django-stubs plugin.
  - `docs/typing/README.md`: how to run locally / via pre-commit / in the test container, plus the per-file graduation workflow.
  - `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`: frozen error list (sorted for stable diffs) so follow-up issues can measure progress.
- **Mypy: typed the auth, users, and notifications packages** (Issue #1333, follow-up to #1331): Brought `config/admin_auth`, `config/graphql_api_token_auth`, `opencontractserver/users`, and `opencontractserver/notifications` to full return-annotation coverage and graduated them out of the mypy baseline. These packages sit on hot paths for authentication, token verification, session handling, and notification dispatch; typing them documents invariants that used to live only in `CLAUDE.md`.
  - Signal handlers (`opencontractserver/users/signals.py`, `opencontractserver/notifications/signals.py`) now declare `sender: type[Model]`, `instance: Model`, `created: bool`, `**kwargs: Any`, and `-> None` so drive-by edits can't silently change the signal contract.
  - `opencontractserver/notifications/__init__.py` gained a module-level docstring calling out that the app deliberately diverges from `AnnotatePermissionsForReadMixin` — a single `recipient` FK is the authoritative visibility gate. The design note in `CLAUDE.md` is referenced so changes to one file flag the other.
  - `mypy.ini`: dropped `[mypy-config.admin_auth.*]`, `[mypy-config.graphql_api_token_auth.backends]`, and `[mypy-opencontractserver.users.models]` `ignore_errors` sections. Added a narrow `disable_error_code = django-manager-missing` on `opencontractserver.users.models` only, documented inline: `django-tree-queries`' `as_manager(with_tree_fields=True)` pattern used by `Corpus`, `CorpusFolder`, and `DocumentPath` creates manager classes at runtime that the `mypy_django_plugin` can't introspect, so reverse `_set` accessors on `User` can't resolve — a known plugin limitation, not a code error. Graduating those three models with explicit manager typing will let us delete the disable.
  - `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`: pruned all 20 entries for the graduated modules.
  - Bug fixes uncovered by typing:
    - `config/graphql_api_token_auth/backends.py`: `ApiKeyBackend.authenticate_header` referenced `self.keyword` but the attribute was never declared. DRF calls this on 401 responses to build the `WWW-Authenticate` header, so an unauthenticated request would have hit `AttributeError` at response time. Added `keyword: str = "Token"` as a class attribute.
    - `opencontractserver/notifications/signals.py`: `create_moderation_notification` dereferenced `action.moderator.username` unconditionally, but the `ModerationAction.moderator` FK permits `NULL`. A moderation action created without a moderator would crash the signal handler (and therefore the originating save). Added an explicit early return with a debug log when `action.moderator is None`.

### Changed

- **Decomposed `ModernDocumentItem.tsx`** (Issue #1446, `frontend/src/components/documents/ModernDocumentItem.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/documents/ModernDocumentItem.styles.ts` (new), `frontend/src/components/documents/DocumentRelationshipList.tsx` (new)): The component had grown to 1,699 lines with ~755 lines of `styled-components` definitions and a relationship-popup body duplicated verbatim across the card and list view branches. Extracted all styled-components into a sibling `ModernDocumentItem.styles.ts` (re-exported by name) and lifted the duplicated relationship popup body into a shared `DocumentRelationshipList` component used by both views. Net: main component file dropped from 1,699 → 870 lines (49% reduction) while remaining behaviorally identical — the public `ModernDocumentItem` export, prop signature, and DOM structure are unchanged. All 42 component tests in `frontend/tests/ModernDocumentItem.ct.tsx` and `frontend/tests/document-failure-overlay.ct.tsx` pass without modification, confirming the refactor is semantics-preserving. First slice of the multi-PR decomposition tracked by issue #1446.
- **Centralized extract and user-profile route resolution in `CentralRouteManager`** (`frontend/src/routing/CentralRouteManager.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/routes/ExtractDetailRoute.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/routes/UserProfileRoute.tsx`, new `frontend/src/components/routes/ProfileRedirect.tsx`, `frontend/src/utils/navigationUtils.ts`, `frontend/src/graphql/cache.ts`): `ExtractDetailRoute` and `UserProfileRoute` were each calling `useParams()`, running their own GraphQL resolution queries, and writing entity reactive vars — duplicating the four-phase flow documented in `docs/frontend/routing_system.md` and racing the manager during back-navigation. Both are now thin consumers that read `openedExtract` / `openedUser` / `routeLoading` / `routeError`. `parseRoute` learned `/users/:slug` and `/extracts/:extractId`; the manager added a `GET_USER` lazy query and a Phase 1 user branch alongside the existing extract handling. New `openedUser` reactive var (typed `OpenedUserProfile`) joins the routing-owned set. `/profile` is now served by a small `ProfileRedirect` that uses `backendUserObj` to redirect to `/users/<slug>` — auth-driven, not URL-driven, so legitimately outside the manager. Smaller fixes that ride along: `views/Corpuses.tsx:1807` swaps `window.history.replaceState` for `navigate({ pathname, search }, { replace: true })` so query-param mutations stay inside React Router; redundant `openedLabelset(null)` calls in `LabelSetDetailPage` and `LabelSetLandingRoute` handlers were removed (Phase 1 already clears the var on browse navigation).
  - Test coverage: 8 new `parseRoute` tests, 3 new manager tests (user resolve, user not-found, extract by id), updated `beforeEach` to reset `openedExtract` / `openedUser`. New `frontend/src/routing/__tests__/centralRouteDiscipline.test.ts` is a static regression test that grep-walks `frontend/src/` and fails if any production file outside the manager and `cache.ts` SETs one of the 15 routing-owned reactive vars — caught three pre-existing `openedLabelset` writes during development that were also fixed in this PR. New `frontend/tests/e2e/user-and-extract-routes.spec.ts` deep-links `/users/<slug>`, verifies the `/profile` redirect, and exercises the dumb-consumer error path on `/extracts/<unknown-id>`. `tests/e2e/helpers.ts` `VIEWS` catalog now includes `/users/admin` so the existing login-and-navigation walk also covers the user route.
  - Doc updates: `docs/frontend/routing_system.md` route-pattern table now lists `/users/:slug`, `/extracts/:extractId`, and `/label_sets/:labelsetId`; the "ONLY CentralRouteManager may SET" list and the four critical RULE blocks were extended to include `openedThread`, `openedLabelset`, and `openedUser`; the new discipline test is referenced as the CI enforcement mechanism.
- **Pre-existing `tsc` failure on `frontend/src/components/corpuses/caml/CamlDirectiveRenderer.tsx`** resolved by refreshing `@os-legal/caml-react` to `0.1.0` (latest on the registry). The lockfile had been pinned to `0.0.1`, whose published `dist/index.d.ts` lacks the `resolveImageSrc` prop that the consumer passes through; `0.1.0` ships the prop on `CamlArticleProps`, `CamlChapterRendererProps`, and the block-renderer prop interfaces. `yarn upgrade @os-legal/caml-react@^0.1.0 @os-legal/caml@^0.1.0` updates the lockfile; no code changes needed.
- **Simplified `RelationGroup.updateForAnnotationDeletion` pruning logic** (Issue #1317, follow-up to #1314, `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/annotations.ts:40-60`): The method previously branched on four near-duplicate conditions (`sourceEmpty && nowTargetEmpty`, `targetEmpty && nowSourceEmpty`, `!sourceEmpty && nowSourceEmpty`, `!targetEmpty && nowTargetEmpty`) each returning `undefined`. All four are equivalent to a single `nowSourceEmpty || nowTargetEmpty` check (`filter` is monotonic, so an originally-empty side stays empty after filtering). Collapsed the branches and removed the now-unused `sourceEmpty` / `targetEmpty` locals per the project's DRY guideline. Behavior is unchanged; existing regression tests in `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/__tests__/annotations.test.ts` still pass unmodified, confirming the simplification is semantics-preserving.
- **Frontend Vitest unit coverage provider switched from V8 to Istanbul** (`frontend/vite.config.ts:210-230`, `frontend/package.json:154`, `frontend/yarn.lock`): The merged `frontend` Codecov flag was landing at ~44% even though `frontend-component` alone was at ~61% on the same code — impossible for a union-aggregated metric unless the three per-suite uploads were measuring on different yardsticks. Root cause: Vitest's `@vitest/coverage-v8` provider emits ~183 `DA:` records per source file (~86k across ~480 files) because V8's native coverage API reports hits for nearly every executable line — imports, declarations, block-closing `}`, etc. — as needed for engine profiling and DevTools. `vite-plugin-istanbul` (used by Playwright CT and E2E suites) emits ~61 `DA:` per file (~27k total) because it only instruments statements. Same code, ~3× denominator mismatch. When Codecov unions multiple uploads under one flag it keeps V8's larger line-number set; Istanbul hits from CT/E2E land on a subset of those line numbers and can never close the gap. Swapped the unit-coverage provider to Istanbul so all three suites report on the same universe. Swapped the `@vitest/coverage-v8` devDep for `@vitest/coverage-istanbul` at the same `^3.1.2` version to match the `vitest` major.minor, changed `coverage.provider` to `"istanbul"` in the Vitest config, regenerated `yarn.lock`, and updated the `all: true` rationale comment to stop singling out V8. The per-suite `flags:` tagging in `frontend.yml` / `frontend-e2e.yml` is unchanged — server-side aggregation still handles the merge. Verified locally: the new unit lcov reports ~451 `SF:` and ~24k `DA:` (previously ~86k), matching the CT/E2E scale. Trade-off: unit-test runtime under coverage grows somewhat (Istanbul transforms source pre-execution), likely 10–30s on this suite. `tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Removed

- **Dead GraphQL operations and result types removed** (Issue #1244, `frontend/src/graphql/landing-queries.ts`, `frontend/src/graphql/queries/folders.ts`, `frontend/src/graphql/metadataOperations.ts`, `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`, `frontend/src/graphql/mutations.ts`): Removed GraphQL operations and associated TypeScript Input/Output types that were not referenced anywhere in `frontend/src/` or `frontend/tests/`.
  - `landing-queries.ts`: `GET_TRENDING_CORPUSES`, `GET_RECENT_DOCUMENTS` (+ `GetRecentDocumentsOutput`), `GET_COMMUNITY_STATS` (query only — `GetCommunityStatsOutput` interface is still referenced internally by `GetDiscoveryDataOutput`), `GET_GLOBAL_LEADERBOARD` (+ `GetGlobalLeaderboardOutput`).
  - `queries/folders.ts`: `GET_CORPUS_FOLDER` (singular — kept the live `GET_CORPUS_FOLDERS` plural query), `MOVE_DOCUMENTS_TO_FOLDER` (plural — kept the live `MOVE_DOCUMENT_TO_FOLDER` singular), plus the `GetCorpusFolderInputs/Outputs`, `MoveDocumentsToFolderInputs/Outputs`, and `GetDeletedDocumentsInputs/Outputs` type pairs. Kept `GET_DELETED_DOCUMENTS_IN_CORPUS` and `DeletedDocumentPathType` (used by `TrashFolderView.tsx`).
  - `metadataOperations.ts`: `GET_METADATA_COMPLETION_STATUS`, `GetDocumentMetadataDatacellsInput/Output`, `GetMetadataCompletionStatusInput/Output`, `DocumentMetadataResult` (inlined into `GetDocumentsMetadataBatchOutput`).
  - `queries.ts`: `USER_BY_SLUG`, `CORPUS_BY_SLUGS`, `DOCUMENT_BY_SLUGS` (kept live `DOCUMENT_IN_CORPUS_BY_SLUGS` and `RESOLVE_*_FULL` variants), `GET_LABELSET_BY_ID_FOR_REDIRECT`, `REQUEST_PAGE_ANNOTATION_DATA`, `GET_EXPORT` (kept live `GET_EXPORTS`), `GET_FIELDSET` (kept live `GET_FIELDSETS`), `GET_DOCUMENT_ANNOTATIONS_AND_RELATIONSHIPS`, `getAnnotationsByDocumentId`, `listAnnotations`, `GET_DOCUMENT_DETAILS` (kept live `GET_DOCUMENT_KNOWLEDGE_AND_ANNOTATIONS`), `GET_UNREAD_NOTIFICATION_COUNT`, `GET_DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIP_COUNT`, plus all associated Input/Output interfaces.
  - `mutations.ts`: `UPDATE_LABELSET`, `CREATE_ANNOTATION_LABEL` (kept live `CREATE_ANNOTATION_LABEL_FOR_LABELSET`), `SMART_LABEL_LIST` (kept live `SMART_LABEL_SEARCH_OR_CREATE`), `REMOVE_ANNOTATION_LABELS_FROM_LABELSET`, `DELETE_ANNOTATION_LABEL` (kept live `DELETE_MULTIPLE_ANNOTATION_LABELS`), `DELETE_DOCUMENT` (kept live `DELETE_MULTIPLE_DOCUMENTS`), `REQUEST_DELETE_DOC_TYPE_ANNOTATION`, `UPDATE_CORPUS_SETTINGS`, `UPDATE_BADGE`, `AWARD_BADGE`, `REVOKE_BADGE` (kept live `DELETE_BADGE`), `DELETE_CONVERSATION`, `MARK_NOTIFICATION_READ`, `MARK_NOTIFICATION_UNREAD`, `MARK_ALL_NOTIFICATIONS_READ`, `DELETE_NOTIFICATION` (entire notification-mutations block had no call sites), `PERMANENTLY_DELETE_DOCUMENT`, `UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIP`, `DELETE_DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIPS` (kept live `DELETE_DOCUMENT_RELATIONSHIP` singular), plus all associated Input/Output interfaces.
  - Verification: every deletion was preceded by a word-boundary grep (`\bSYMBOL\b`) across both `frontend/src/` and `frontend/tests/`; interfaces that were only referenced by the deleted operations were removed, while interfaces still referenced internally (e.g. `GetCommunityStatsOutput` used by `GetDiscoveryDataOutput`) were preserved. `tsc --noEmit` and `yarn build` pass cleanly.
  - `types/graphql-api.ts` and `types/graphql-slug-queries.ts` were intentionally left untouched per the issue scope — test wrappers and mock fixtures import many type names from these files, and auto-generated structural types are too risky to prune by hand.

### Fixed

- **DRFMutation/DRFDeletion `IOSettings` misconfiguration surfaces as a generic internal error** (Issue #1360, `config/graphql/base.py`): `DRFMutation.IOSettings` declared `model: django.db.models.Model = None`, `graphene_model: DjangoObjectType = None` and `serializer = None` — the type annotations were wrong (instance types, not class types, holding `None`), and there was no runtime guard. A subclass that forgot to override one of those would fail deep inside `mutate()` with an `AttributeError` (`'NoneType' object has no attribute 'objects'`) or `TypeError` (`'NoneType' object is not callable`), which the broad `except Exception` then masks as a generic "internal error" message back to the API caller. `DRFDeletion.IOSettings` had the inverse problem — it didn't declare `model` at all, even though `DRFDeletion.mutate` dereferences `cls.IOSettings.model.objects`. Discovered while working on #1332 (typing): mypy flagged four errors on `base.py:128/204/238/252` plus `base.py:93 "type[IOSettings]" has no attribute "model"`.
  - Retyped both `IOSettings` declarations with `ClassVar[Optional[type[...]]] = None` so the annotation matches reality (holding a class, not an instance, and nullable by default). `pk_fields` narrowed from `list[str | int]` to `list[str]` — the only call sites use it as a dict key.
  - Added `_require_io_setting(mutation_cls, name)` helper that fails fast with `NotImplementedError("<Subclass>.IOSettings.<name> must be set by the subclass.")` when a required attribute is `None` or missing. Called for `model`/`serializer`/`graphene_model` in `DRFMutation.mutate` and for `model` in `DRFDeletion.mutate`. In `DRFMutation` the error is caught by the broad `except Exception` and surfaced as "internal error" to the API, with the full descriptive message in the server log via `logger.error(traceback.format_exc())`. `DRFDeletion.mutate` has no equivalent `try/except` (matching its pre-PR behavior), so the `NotImplementedError` propagates to graphene as a GraphQL execution error — also a fail-fast outcome, just on a different surface.
  - Tightened `DRFDeletion.mutate` to raise `ValueError` when `kwargs[lookup_field]` is missing (the `id` GraphQL argument is `required=False`), instead of passing `None` into `from_global_id` and getting an opaque `AttributeError`. Same propagation surface as the `_require_io_setting` guard above.
  - Fixed pre-existing `to_global_id(graphene_model.__class__.__name__, obj.id)` in both `DRFMutation` create/update return paths: `graphene_model` is the `DjangoObjectType` class, so `.__class__` referenced graphene's metaclass (`SubclassWithMeta_Meta`) and the resulting global id used the wrong type name. Switched to `graphene_model.__name__` to match the GraphQL type name (e.g. `"CorpusType"`) used everywhere else in `config/graphql/`. Surfaced by the new explicit `ClassVar[Optional[type[...]]]` annotations — both call sites stayed dormant because the returned `obj_id` is rarely consumed by the frontend (which re-queries by global id from its own cache).
  - Graduated `config.graphql.base` out of the mypy baseline: removed the `[mypy-config.graphql.base]` section from `mypy.ini` and pruned the ten corresponding lines from `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`. `mypy --config-file mypy.ini` is now clean on this module.
  - Regression tests in `opencontractserver/tests/test_security_hardening.py::TestIOSettingsRequiredFieldsGuard`: the helper raises `NotImplementedError` for each of `model`/`serializer`/`graphene_model` when missing or `None`, returns the configured value when present, and the base classes expose the `None` defaults the guard relies on.
- **`CorpusChat` dropped `SYNC_CONTENT` messages from the visible chat** (Issue #1276, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusChat.tsx:468-505`): The `SYNC_CONTENT` WebSocket frame is a standalone, non-streaming assistant reply used for synchronous server responses. `ChatTray` (document chat) appends these directly to its `chat` state; the corpus-level chat only forwarded the content to `handleCompleteMessage`, which stores sources in `ChatSourceAtom` but never pushes a message to the visible list. As a result, any `SYNC_CONTENT` the backend sent over the corpus socket rendered nothing. Fixed by mirroring the `ChatTray` pattern — push a new complete assistant message into `chat` before persisting sources/timeline. The fallback `crypto.randomUUID()` is also now captured in a single local variable so the visible chat entry and the `ChatSourceAtom` record share the same id when the server omits `message_id`. New regression test in `frontend/tests/CorpusChat.ct.tsx` ("SYNC_CONTENT renders a complete message immediately") pins the behavior.
- **CAML article preview crashed when inserting an extract grid embed** (`frontend/src/utils/camlComponents.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useCamlComponentRenderer.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CamlArticleEditor.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/caml/CamlDirectiveRenderer.tsx`): the editor wrapped each newly-inserted `[component:TYPE ...]` marker in a `::: prose` fence, but `@os-legal/caml`'s parser has no `case "prose"` in `parseBlock`, so the resulting block carried `body` instead of `content`. `ProseBlock` then crashed inside `splitPullquotes(undefined)`, which unmounted the entire editor modal and made the "ArrowDown then Enter inserts the extract-grid component marker" CT test fail. Switched the fence to a project-specific `::: oc-component` block and routed it through `CamlArticle`'s `customBlocks` slot, where the marker text is handed back to the existing `[component:...]` resolver. The keyboard handler in `CamlArticleEditor` was also tightened to read the active picker index from a `useRef` mirror so back-to-back ArrowDown/Enter keystrokes don't observe a stale closure value of `-1` and bail out before insertion.
- **PR #1177 follow-up: CAML extract embed polish** (Issue #1227):
  - **`fullDatacellList` payload now bounded server-side**: `ExtractType.full_datacell_list` accepts optional `limit` / `offset` arguments and the resolver clamps `limit` to `MAX_FULL_DATACELL_LIST_LIMIT` (`opencontractserver/constants/extracts.py`, currently `500`) after permission filtering (`config/graphql/extract_types.py`). `GET_EXTRACT_GRID_EMBED` passes `limit: EXTRACT_GRID_EMBED_CELL_LIMIT` (mirrored at `500` in `frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts`) so pathological extracts no longer transmit thousands of cells just to trigger the too-many-rows guard (`frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`, `frontend/src/components/extracts/ExtractGridEmbed.tsx`). Full server-side pagination is still tracked in #1204.
  - **`resolveComponentMarker` now receives a stable React key from both call sites**: `useCamlComponentRenderer` and `CamlDirectiveRenderer` pass the marker string as the `key` argument so multiple `[component:...]` blocks in a single article reconcile correctly without React's "missing key prop" warnings (`frontend/src/hooks/useCamlComponentRenderer.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/caml/CamlDirectiveRenderer.tsx`). Added regression tests in `frontend/src/utils/__tests__/camlComponents.test.ts`.
  - **Code-point-safe cell value truncation**: `formatCellValue` in `ExtractGridEmbed` now slices on `Array.from(json)` instead of `String.substring`, so cell values containing emoji or other non-BMP characters are no longer truncated mid-surrogate-pair (which previously emitted `U+FFFD` replacement glyphs).
  - **Keyboard navigation in CAML extract picker**: Added a listbox keyboard handler to the "Insert Extract Grid" dropdown in `CamlArticleEditor` — Arrow keys / Home / End move the focused option, Enter selects, Escape closes and returns focus to the trigger button. Active option is reflected via `aria-activedescendant` and an `$active` highlight on `ExtractPickerItem`.
  - **`buildSourceLink` page-indexing convention documented**: Added an explanatory comment clarifying that `Annotation.page` is 1-based (model default=1) and is only used for the chip label (`p.{page}`) — the document viewer navigates by `annotationId` alone, so there is no URL-layer indexing convention to worry about (`frontend/src/components/extracts/ExtractGridEmbed.tsx`).
  - **Verified `GET_EXTRACTS` already selects `fullDocumentList`** (`frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts:1901`) and that `CamlDirectiveRenderer` still wires `resolveImageSrc` through to `MarkdownMessageRenderer` — both no-ops requested by the issue's verification items.
- **`User.__init__` mutated the shared `Field.validators` list on every instantiation** (Issue #1358, `opencontractserver/users/models.py:150-153`): `User.__init__` overwrote `self._meta.get_field("username").validators[0]` with a fresh `UserUnicodeUsernameValidator()` on every `User(...)` construction — including every ORM hydration, form save, and QuerySet materialisation. Two problems: (1) per-instance allocation + assignment on a hot path, and (2) a hard-coded `validators[0]` index that would silently flip the slot back to Django's default `UnicodeUsernameValidator` if any third-party code or future migration prepended a validator, breaking usernames that rely on `\` or `|`. Fix: declare the validator on the `username` field at class-body time (`opencontractserver/users/models.py:78-90`) and drop the `__init__` override. Added migration `0026_alter_user_username_validator.py` to update the stored field definition. Regression tests in `opencontractserver/tests/test_user_username_validator.py` verify the validator survives repeated instantiation and continues to accept `\`, `|`, `*`.
- **`RemoveLabelsFromLabelsetMutation` silently did nothing** (Issue #1359, `config/graphql/label_mutations.py:296`): The resolver referenced `labelset.documents.filter(pk__in=label_pks)`, but `LabelSet` has no `documents` relation — the M2M to labels is `annotation_labels` (see `opencontractserver/annotations/models.py:1284`). Every invocation therefore raised `AttributeError`, which was swallowed by the surrounding `except Exception as e:` block and returned as a generic `"Error removing label(s) from labelset: ..."` with `ok=False`. Because the frontend `REMOVE_ANNOTATION_LABELS_FROM_LABELSET` mutation was itself unused (#1244 swept it out), this bug went unnoticed in production for an unknown length of time; discovered while grading mypy errors for #1332 (`config/graphql/label_mutations.py:296: error: "LabelSet" has no attribute "documents"  [attr-defined]`). Swapped `documents` → `annotation_labels`, removed the now-resolved error from `docs/typing/mypy_baseline.txt`, and added `opencontractserver/tests/test_label_mutations.py` with four regression cases covering: labels are actually removed from the M2M, IDs not in the labelset are silently ignored, a non-owner / non-public caller cannot mutate the labelset, and a public labelset remains editable (pinning the current `Q(creator=user) | Q(is_public=True)` resolver behaviour so any future permission hardening is explicit).
- **`package_annotated_docs` silently corrupted exports when a document failed to burn** (Issue #1356, `opencontractserver/tasks/export_tasks.py:150-212`, `opencontractserver/utils/etl.py:198-463`, `opencontractserver/tasks/doc_tasks.py:463-504`): `build_document_export()` returns `("", "", None, {}, {})` when a per-document export fails (e.g. the underlying file cannot be loaded). The V1 consumer `package_annotated_docs` had no guard for that placeholder — it ran `doc[1].encode("utf-8")` on the empty string (harmless, no crash), wrote an empty-named entry into the zip, and inserted `annotated_docs[""] = None` into the final `data.json`, so a single failed document silently poisoned the export. The V2 pipeline in `export_tasks_v2.py:126-128` already has this guard; V1 did not. Added `if not doc_name or doc_export is None: continue` (mirroring V2's check) and logged a warning identifying the skipped doc. Also tightened the return-type annotations on `build_document_export` and `burn_doc_annotations`: slots 0 and 1 are always `str` (never `None`; they are empty strings on the failure path), so the signature is now `tuple[str, str, OpenContractDocExport | None, dict[...], dict[...]]`. Corrected the `burned_docs` parameter annotation on `package_annotated_docs` from a single-element tuple-of-tuples to a variadic `tuple[tuple[...], ...]` — the runtime iteration is variadic, and the previous annotation was a red herring uncovered while typing for #1334. Regression test in `opencontractserver/tests/test_package_annotated_docs.py` covers both the mixed-success and all-failed scenarios, asserting the zip contains no empty-named entries and `annotated_docs` holds no `None` values.
- **Frontend coverage badge stuck on "unknown"** (`README.md:12`, `.github/workflows/codecov-notify.yml`, `.github/workflows/frontend.yml`, `.github/workflows/frontend-e2e.yml`, `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/yarn.lock`): PR #1322 pointed the README badge at a new merged `frontend` flag fed by a cross-workflow `lcov-result-merger@5` step inside `codecov-notify.yml`. Every `frontend-merged-coverage` upload since has landed at Codecov with `state: error` / `totals: null`, so the badge rendered "unknown" even though `frontend-unit` (31%), `frontend-component` (61%), and `frontend-e2e` (24%) were all processing correctly. Two defects in the merged lcov confirmed by local repro of the CI merge step: (1) `lcov-result-merger@5` emits a stripped lcov containing only `SF:`, `DA:`, `BRDA:`, `end_of_record` — it drops `TN:`, `FN`, `FNDA`, `FNF`, `FNH`, `LF`, `LH`, `BRF`, `BRH`, so line-summary fields required by Codecov's parser are absent; (2) Vitest v8 emits `src/...` (relative to `frontend/`) while `vite-plugin-istanbul` + `nyc report` emit `/home/runner/work/OpenContracts/OpenContracts/frontend/src/...` (absolute), and the merger keys on the literal path string so the same file appears as two records with conflicting hit counts. `codecov-notify.yml` also ran without `actions/checkout`, which Codecov's action docs explicitly recommend against. Fix: stop merging client-side and let Codecov aggregate server-side, since that is what flags are for. Each per-suite upload now declares two flags — `frontend-unit,frontend`, `frontend-component,frontend`, `frontend-e2e,frontend` — so the `frontend` flag total is the union of the three uploads computed by Codecov. `codecov-notify.yml` is reduced to its original gate-and-notify role (no artifact downloads, no `lcov-result-merger`, no merged upload). Deleted the `frontend-{unit,ct,e2e}-lcov` artifact publishes in `frontend.yml` / `frontend-e2e.yml`, removed the `lcov-result-merger@^5.0.1` devDep and the `coverage:merge` script from `frontend/package.json`, and pruned the orphaned entries from `frontend/yarn.lock`. README badge URL unchanged (`flag=frontend`).

### Changed

- **PR #1297 follow-up — tighten component tests and unit-test coverage** (Issue #1321):
  - `frontend/src/components/documents/__tests__/DocumentRelationshipModal.test.ts`: added a test that pins the `labelType: undefined` edge case for `filterRelationshipLabels` (previously only `null` non-relationship labels were covered), so the strict-equality guard against non-`RelationshipLabel` types is explicit.
  - `frontend/tests/ModernDocumentItem.ct.tsx`:
    - Extended the `__reactProps$` upgrade-risk comments on `clickViaReact` / `openContextMenu` to call out the build-hash suffix explicitly — the suffix rotates on every React build, so `Object.keys(el).find(k => k.startsWith("__reactProps$"))` is the only correct lookup pattern.
    - `openContextMenu` now falls back to a full-document scan for an element with a React `onContextMenu` prop when the `.checkbox` anchor is absent (e.g. future conditional rendering of read-only items). The primary checkbox path is unchanged.
    - Added `NOTE` comments on the relationship-popup `toBeAttached()` assertions explaining that they only verify DOM presence (the popup uses `visibility: hidden` + hover reveal) and when to switch to `toBeVisible()` instead.
  - `frontend/tests/DocumentRelationshipModal.ct.tsx`:
    - Replaced the DOM-order `removeButtons.nth(1)` assertion in the "removes document from target column" test with an XPath-based walk from the pill's visible title, so re-ordering the source/target layout can no longer silently test the wrong button.
    - Strengthened the mutation-failure negative assertion: after submitting a failing mutation, wait for the submit button to re-enable (a positive signal that the `isSubmitting` finally-block has executed) before polling `onSuccessCalled === false`. Prevents the poll from passing immediately on the initial `false` value.
  - `frontend/tests/utils/ReactiveVarObserver.tsx`: expanded the doc comment with a three-step recipe for extending the observer to additional reactive vars, matching the existing `viewingDocument` / `editingDocument` convention.

### Fixed

- **Backend CI build aborted on transient SSL failure mid-wheel-download** (`compose/local/django/Dockerfile`, `compose/production/django/Dockerfile`): Backend CI run `24646911374` on commit `233a9b67` (push to `main`) failed in the `Build the Stack` step with `ssl.SSLError: [SSL] record layer failure (_ssl.c:2590)` at 22 MB of 60.4 MB while `pip wheel` was downloading `opencv-python-headless`, aborting the entire build and cascading skips through `Run DB Migrations`, `Verify Docker Containers`, and `pytest`. Pip's default `--retries 5` only covers connection setup and does not resume broken mid-stream downloads — that behaviour is gated on `--resume-retries`, added in pip 24.1 (env var `PIP_RESUME_RETRIES`). Added `ENV PIP_RETRIES=10 PIP_TIMEOUT=60 PIP_RESUME_RETRIES=5` to both the `python-build-stage` and `python-run-stage` of both Dockerfiles so every `pip install` / `pip wheel` invocation (wheel build, `--upgrade pip`, spacy model downloads) picks up the hardened settings. Verified the base image (`pytorch/pytorch:2.7.1-cuda12.6-cudnn9-runtime`) ships pip 25.1.1 and recognises all three env vars (`pip config list` reports `:env:.resume-retries='5'`, `pip install --help` shows `--timeout (default 60.0 seconds)`).
- **`fullDatacellList` no-args path was unbounded** (Issue #1256, follow-up to PR #1235, `config/graphql/extract_types.py:131-148`): `ExtractType.resolve_full_datacell_list` capped the `limit` and `offset-only` branches at `MAX_FULL_DATACELL_LIST_LIMIT` but returned the entire queryset when called with no arguments. Authenticated callers hitting `fullDatacellList` directly (no `limit`, no `offset`) could bypass the payload bound. Collapsed all three code paths so every call — no-args, offset-only, or `limit`+`offset` — returns `qs[start : start + min(limit_or_max, MAX_FULL_DATACELL_LIST_LIMIT)]`. The embed UI is unaffected (it already passes `limit: 500`); direct API callers now receive at most 500 cells and must paginate via `offset` to walk the rest. Added regression test `test_full_datacell_list_no_args_capped_at_server_max` in `opencontractserver/tests/test_extract_queries.py` which creates 501 cells and asserts the no-args response returns exactly `MAX_FULL_DATACELL_LIST_LIMIT` while `datacellCount` reports the true total.

### Changed

- **Dual-constant sync warnings for `MAX_FULL_DATACELL_LIST_LIMIT` / `EXTRACT_GRID_EMBED_CELL_LIMIT`** (Issue #1256, `opencontractserver/constants/extracts.py`, `frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts:351-364`): Both constants now carry explicit `IMPORTANT: ... CI sync-check tracked in issue #1256` warnings so future edits are obvious. Updated the GraphQL schema description on `fullDatacellList(limit:)` to document the server cap rather than claiming the omitted-limit case returns everything. Corrected the stale "N+1: issues a COUNT(\*) per ExtractType instance" comment on `resolve_datacell_count` to reflect that the embed path issues a `COUNT(*)` in addition to the main list query. Added a `TODO` reference to #1256 next to the `ExtractQueryOptimizer` circular-import inline import in `_get_datacell_qs`.
- **Backend CI `changes` job failed on every push to main** (`.github/workflows/backend.yml`): `dorny/paths-filter@v3` was declared without a prior `actions/checkout`, on the stated premise that the action "fetches diffs via the GitHub API". That is only true for `pull_request` events; on `push` events the action shells out to `git branch --show-current`, which fails with `fatal: not a git repository` when the workspace is empty. Every push to a protected branch therefore produced a red X on the `changes` job, silently masked by `continue-on-error: true` plus a `|| github.event_name == 'push'` fail-open gate on downstream jobs. Scoped the `changes` job to `pull_request` events (`if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'`) — where paths-filter actually works — and rewrote the downstream gates on `linter` / `pytest` as `if: always() && (github.event_name == 'push' || needs.changes.outputs.backend != 'false')` so the skip cascade from a `needs`-target that is now intentionally skipped on push does not block the real test jobs. Behaviour preserved: push always runs `linter` + `pytest`; PRs with no backend changes still skip both; PRs where the filter errors transiently (outputs.backend == '') still fail open.

- **Frontend CI tippy-debug step removed** (`.github/workflows/frontend.yml`): Dropped the `Debug - Check for tippy references` step in the `lint` job — a leftover investigation artifact that ran on every PR/push and produced noise with no diagnostic value today. Flagged in Issue #1319.

- **Codecov-notify `matching[0]` relied on undocumented API ordering** (`.github/workflows/codecov-notify.yml`): The cross-workflow coordinator picked the "most recent" workflow run per expected name by indexing `matching[0]` on the filter result, leaning on the GitHub Actions REST API returning results newest-first. That ordering is not guaranteed. Added an explicit `created_at` descending sort before taking `matching[0]`, so re-run detection is correct regardless of API-side quirks. Flagged in Issue #1319.

- **Frontend coverage badge reported ~31% despite months of added tests** (`README.md:12`, `.github/workflows/codecov-notify.yml`, `.codecov.yml`, `frontend/vite.config.ts:210-223`): The README's "Frontend coverage" badge was pointing at `flag=frontend-unit` — the Vitest slice only. The three frontend suites (Vitest unit, Playwright component via `vite-plugin-istanbul`, Playwright E2E via `vite-plugin-istanbul`) upload to separate Codecov flags (`frontend-unit`, `frontend-component`, `frontend-e2e`) and were never merged into a single lcov. Recent PRs almost exclusively added Playwright component and E2E tests, so their coverage landed in `frontend-component`/`frontend-e2e` while the badge stayed stuck reading the Vitest slice.
  - Added an `Upload {unit,CT,E2E} lcov artifact` step (using `actions/upload-artifact@v7`) to each producing job in `.github/workflows/frontend.yml` (`component-test` and `unit-test`) and `.github/workflows/frontend-e2e.yml` (`e2e`). The existing per-flag Codecov uploads are untouched, so per-suite drill-in still works.
  - Extended the existing cross-workflow coordinator at `.github/workflows/codecov-notify.yml` to download the three artifacts by run id (via `actions/download-artifact@v7` with `continue-on-error: true` to tolerate path-filtered skips and upload failures), merge them with `npx lcov-result-merger@5`, and upload the combined lcov to Codecov under a new `frontend` flag before calling `send-notifications`. The existing `listWorkflowRunsForRepo` check already discovers the producing runs by SHA — it now also emits `frontend_ci_run_id` and `frontend_e2e_run_id` outputs for the downloads to consume.
  - Added the `frontend` flag to `.codecov.yml` (paths: `frontend/src/`, `carryforward: true`). Intentionally does not match the `frontend-.*` regex used by the `frontend` component's `flag_regexes`, so the component keeps aggregating only the three per-suite flags and does not double-count the merged upload.
  - Pointed the README badge at `flag=frontend` so the displayed number reflects the union of all three suites.
  - Fixed a secondary v8 issue at `frontend/vite.config.ts:210-223`: added `all: true` to the Vitest coverage block. Without it, v8 silently drops files not imported by any unit test, inflating the `frontend-unit` ratio and misaligning the v8 lcov's file universe with the Istanbul-based component/E2E lcovs (which do enumerate all source files). Aligning the two is required for the merged `frontend` lcov to be meaningful.
  - Added `lcov-result-merger@^5.0.1` as a `frontend/package.json` devDependency with a local `coverage:merge` script so the merge can be reproduced locally (`yarn test:coverage:unit && yarn test:coverage:ct && yarn test:e2e:coverage && yarn coverage:merge`).

### Changed

- **`fullDatacellList` caps caller-supplied `limit` at `MAX_FULL_DATACELL_LIST_LIMIT` (500)** (Issue #1227): The resolver for `ExtractType.fullDatacellList` now clamps the `limit` argument to `MAX_FULL_DATACELL_LIST_LIMIT = 500` (`opencontractserver/constants/extracts.py`) regardless of what the caller requests. Callers that pass no `limit` still get every datacell (full pagination is tracked in #1204); the cap only applies once `limit` is supplied, so a caller asking for `limit: 10_000` is transparently answered with at most 500 rows per request.

- **Simplify `RelationGroup.updateForAnnotationDeletion` pruning branches** (Issue #1316, `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/annotations.ts:40-59`): The four conditional branches that each returned `undefined` collectively covered exactly `newSourceIds.length === 0 || newTargetIds.length === 0`, and the `sourceEmpty` / `targetEmpty` pre-filter variables were only referenced inside those branches. Collapsed the four conditions into a single `if` and removed the now-unused pre-filter variables. No behavior change — existing `RelationGroup > .updateForAnnotationDeletion()` regression tests still pass unchanged (all 28 tests in `annotations.test.ts` pass; `tsc --noEmit` clean).
- **Harden backend CI path-filter job** (Issue #1290, `.github/workflows/backend.yml`): Tightened the `changes` path-filter job so transient `dorny/paths-filter` failures no longer silently skip `linter` / `pytest`.
  - Dropped the redundant `actions/checkout` step in the `changes` job — `dorny/paths-filter@v3` fetches diffs via the GitHub API and does not need a local clone.
  - Added `Dockerfile*` to the backend path filter so root-level Dockerfile changes (which directly affect the backend build environment) correctly trigger backend CI.
  - Marked the `changes` job `continue-on-error: true` so a transient GitHub API failure does not fail the workflow.
  - Changed the downstream gate from `needs.changes.outputs.backend == 'true'` to `needs.changes.outputs.backend != 'false'` on both `linter` and `pytest`. With `continue-on-error: true`, a failed `changes` job produces an empty-string output; the old `== 'true'` gate evaluated to `false` for PR events and silently skipped downstream jobs — the exact failure mode the "fail open" comment claimed to prevent. The new `!= 'false'` gate runs downstream jobs for both the happy path (`'true'`) and the transient-failure path (`''`), only skipping when the filter explicitly reports no backend changes (`'false'`).
  - Reworded the linter path-filter comment to clarify that gating only affects PRs with no backend changes; push events to protected branches still run unconditionally.

### Fixed

- **`ChatMessage` source indicator no longer renders "1 sources"** (`frontend/src/components/widgets/chat/ChatMessage.tsx:1993`): the source indicator always used the plural noun regardless of count, while every other pluralized label in the component ("1 Source", "1 step", "1 tool") switched correctly. Updated to `"1 source" / "N sources"` to match.
- **`DocumentRelationshipModal` "Create label" button never appeared** (Issue #1280, `frontend/src/components/documents/DocumentRelationshipModal.tsx`): `@os-legal/ui`'s Dropdown only fires `onSearchChange` in `searchable="async"` mode — with `searchable="local"` the parent's `labelSearchTerm` state never updated, so the `labelSearchTerm`-gated "Create label: ..." empty-state button was permanently hidden. Switched the Dropdown to `async`, moved option filtering into a `useMemo(filteredRelationshipLabels, [relationLabels, hasCorpus, labelSearchTerm])`, and added the missing dep. Now typing a novel label name surfaces the Create button as designed.
- **`RelationGroup.updateForAnnotationDeletion` pre-filter length check** (Issue #1288): `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/annotations.ts:49-50` computed `nowSourceEmpty` / `nowTargetEmpty` from the pre-filter `this.sourceIds` / `this.targetIds`, so the "now empty" conditions were identical to the "before" conditions and the pruning branches that return `undefined` were dead code. Deleting the sole source or sole target of a relation left the relation orphaned, pointing at a deleted annotation id. Fixed by reading from the post-filter `newSourceIds` / `newTargetIds`. Called from `PdfAnnotations.undoAnnotation()`, so undo now properly drops any relation whose last source or target was the popped annotation. New regression tests under `RelationGroup > .updateForAnnotationDeletion()` cover all four pruning branches plus the survive-with-updated-ids and unchanged cases, and the existing `undoAnnotation` test that pinned the wrong behaviour was corrected.
  - Additionally fixed a surviving-relation identity drop in the same method: the post-prune return previously constructed `new RelationGroup(newSourceIds, newTargetIds, this.label)` without forwarding `this.id` / `this.structural`, so relations that merely lost a member were silently reassigned a fresh uuid and had their `structural` flag cleared. Both fields are now preserved, and the survival tests assert `updated!.id === rel.id` (plus `structural === true` where applicable) to pin the behaviour.

- **`useAgentChat` WebSocket reconnects on every approval-gate transition** (Issue #1296): `frontend/src/hooks/useAgentChat.ts` had `pendingApproval` in the main WebSocket `useEffect` dependency array, so every `ASYNC_APPROVAL_NEEDED` / `ASYNC_APPROVAL_RESULT` / `ASYNC_CONTENT` / `ASYNC_FINISH` message that set or cleared approval state tore the socket down and recreated it mid-conversation. Impacts: approval decisions could race the reconnect and silently fail (`isConnected` flipped to `false` before the fresh socket opened), in-flight streaming tokens were dropped whenever an approval gate opened/closed, and the server saw a brand-new consumer attaching mid-run. Fix: mirror `pendingApproval` in a `pendingApprovalRef` updated by a separate effect (`useAgentChat.ts:291-299`), read `pendingApprovalRef.current` from the `ASYNC_CONTENT` / `ASYNC_APPROVAL_RESULT` / `ASYNC_FINISH` branches of `onmessage` (`useAgentChat.ts:651-752`), and drop `pendingApproval` from the socket effect's dependency array (`useAgentChat.ts:802-818`). Tests in `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useAgentChat.test.tsx`: removed the previous `_open()` workarounds around approval events, replaced the old "reconnects on approval state change" regression test with a new `does not reconnect the socket when approval state changes (issue #1296)` guard that asserts `wsInstances.length` is unchanged, `originalSocket.close` was not called, and the approval decision is dispatched through the original socket. All 23 tests still pass.
- **Forced-by-selected-relation visibility now respects explicit user selection regardless of `showStructural`** (Issues #1289, #1294): In `frontend/src/components/annotator/hooks/useVisibleAnnotations.ts:54-62`, the IDs forced visible by a selected relation were previously only merged into `forcedIds` inside the `if (showStructural)` branch. With structural annotations toggled off, clicking a relation in the sidebar failed to highlight its member annotations — making the relation sidebar effectively unusable in that mode. Moved the `forcedBySelectedRelationIds` merge outside the structural branch so explicit user selection always wins (consistent with the existing `forcedBySelection` treatment). Structural-relationships auto-forcing (`showStructuralRelationships`) remains gated on `showStructural`, since that path is implicit rather than user-initiated.

  - Updated `frontend/src/components/annotator/hooks/__tests__/useVisibleAnnotations.test.tsx`: replaced the pinning test that documented the bug ("does NOT apply forced-by-selected-relation when showStructural is false") with two assertions verifying the corrected behavior — forced-by-selected-relation now applies to both non-structural annotations (overriding a label filter) and structural annotations when `showStructural` is false. All 16 tests in the file pass; `tsc --noEmit` clean.

- **`useUpdateAnnotation` lost sibling annotations on update** (`frontend/src/components/annotator/hooks/AnnotationHooks.tsx:386`): The hook called `replaceAnnotations([updatedAnnotation])`, which collapses the whole `annotations` array down to the single passed-in element. On any document with more than one annotation, updating one annotation silently dropped the others. Fixed by using `setPdfAnnotations` with a `.map` that swaps only the matching id; regression test added in `AnnotationHooks.test.tsx` (see `useUpdateAnnotation > updates one annotation in place without dropping siblings`).

### Added

- **Frontend coverage for widgets, modals, and icon-picker** (Issue #1279): Added one vitest suite and three Playwright CT suites targeting ~2,150 uncovered lines in `frontend/src/components/widgets/`:
  - `frontend/src/components/widgets/icon-picker/__tests__/icons.test.ts` — 450 tests (≥90% target). Validates every entry in the Lucide catalog has a valid kebab-case `name`, non-empty trimmed `label`, and a `category` that belongs to the declared `IconCategory` union; asserts name uniqueness, that every declared category contains at least one icon, that the derived `LUCIDE_ICON_NAMES` set and `findIconEntry` map stay in sync with `LUCIDE_ICONS`, and a floor of 300 curated icons as a snapshot guard.
  - `frontend/tests/ChatMessageCoverage.ct.tsx` — 16 tests pushing `ChatMessage.tsx` past the 60% floor (from 50%). Covers user vs assistant header rendering, markdown (bold/code/lists/GFM tables), `onSelect` wiring, source-indicator visibility, all three approval-pill states, sources-preview expand/collapse + per-chip expand + chip `onClick`, timeline collapsed-by-default for long completed messages + header expansion + short-timeline default-expanded path + streaming `showTimelineOnly` branch.
  - `frontend/tests/FieldsetModal.ct.tsx` + `frontend/tests/FieldsetModalTestWrapper.tsx` + `frontend/tests/FieldsetModalMocks.ts` — 11 tests. Covers create-mode header/empty state/disabled-save, footer validation transitions (name-required → column-required), column add via the embedded `CreateColumnModal`, column delete with counter update, edit-mode prefill from `REQUEST_GET_FIELDSET`, and all three close paths (Cancel / X / overlay).
  - `frontend/tests/SelectAnalyzerOrFieldsetModal.ct.tsx` + `frontend/tests/SelectAnalyzerOrFieldsetModalTestWrapper.tsx` + `frontend/tests/SelectAnalyzerOrFieldsetModalMocks.ts` — 16 tests. Covers analyzer-grid rendering, document vs corpus subtitle, result-count pill, debounced search filter, "no match" and "none available" empty states, selection flipping Run↔Configure, schema preview toggle, tab switching (analyzer ↔ fieldset), pagination across 12 analyzers, and all three close paths.
  - Verification: 450/450 vitest + 43/43 Playwright CT (stable across 3 consecutive runs); `tsc --noEmit` clean; prettier clean.
- **Knowledge-base document viewer CT coverage remediation** (Issue #1277): Added ~1,400 lines of new Playwright component tests across the four highest-uncovered files in `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/` — `DocumentKnowledgeBase.tsx` (1,961 LOC / 25.5%), `right_tray/ChatTray.tsx` (1,417 / 25.3%), `unified_feed/RelationshipActionModal.tsx` (549 / 16.2%), and `unified_feed/UnifiedContentFeed.tsx` (577 / 29.8%). All new tests use the existing `*TestWrapper` pattern and drive the UI through `--reporter=list` as required by CLAUDE.md.

  - `frontend/tests/RelationshipActionModal.ct.tsx` — Expanded from 3 to 16 specs. New coverage: corpus-loaded rendering, role-picker + add-to-existing flow with callback assertion, structural-relationship filtering, create-mode search + label-list filtering, "no labelset" warning, create-label form round-trip (open, cancel, submit via `SMART_LABEL_SEARCH_OR_CREATE` mock, change selected label), create-mode submit enablement, full submission (source/target pill assignment → `onCreate(labelId, sourceIds, targetIds)` verification), cancel → `onClose`, `getAnnotationPreview` ellipsis truncation at 30 chars, and singular/plural `Selected: N annotation(s)` rendering.
  - `frontend/tests/RelationshipActionModalTestWrapper.tsx` — Extended to accept `withCorpus` / `hasLabelset` / `relationLabels` / `onAddToExisting` / `onCreate` / `onClose` / `corpusId` props. Seeds `corpusStateAtom` via an internal `CorpusSetupInner` children-wrapping effect component (children-wrapping rather than null-returning to satisfy Playwright CT's babel transform, which silently fails to mount otherwise).
  - `frontend/tests/RelationshipActionModalFixtures.ts` — New plain `.ts` fixtures file hosting `buildRelationLabel`. Kept separate from the `.tsx` wrapper to avoid the Playwright CT split-import rule (pitfall #16 in `CLAUDE.md`).
  - `frontend/tests/UnifiedContentFeed.ct.tsx` — Expanded with 8 new specs: multi-select selection-toolbar appearance & count, Select All, Clear, "Add to Relationship" opens `RelationshipActionModal`, read-only hides the checkbox, `noCorpus` hides the toolbar entirely, sort-by-type, note search-query filter, annotation rawText search-query filter, structural filter, `STRUCTURAL_LABEL_PREFIX` always-hidden invariant, and content-type routing (relationship-only).
  - `frontend/tests/UnifiedContentFeedTestWrapper.tsx` — Added `noCorpus`, `showStructural`, `searchText`, and `textSearchMatches` props so the new tests can exercise the no-corpus and structural branches without mounting the component directly.
  - `frontend/tests/ChatTray.ct.tsx` — Added 10 new specs covering empty conversation list, Back-to-Conversations (exitConversation + refetch), ASYNC_ERROR → Reconnect banner, new-chat FAB path, no-op Enter on empty input, sub-90% no character counter, Shift+Enter newline, context-meter rendering via `ASYNC_FINISH` `context_status`, compaction banner via `ASYNC_THOUGHT` with `compaction` metadata, SYNC_CONTENT standalone assistant message, and readOnly-style start path.
  - `frontend/tests/DocumentKnowledgeBase.ct.tsx` — Added 2 new specs covering the `!documentId` invalid-document error modal and its Close-button `handleClose` callback.
  - Verification: full CT suite (`yarn test:ct --reporter=list`) — **1,523 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed**.

- **Component test coverage for `ModernDocumentItem` and `DocumentRelationshipModal`** (Issue #1280): Added ~1,600 lines of Playwright CT coverage for two high-traffic document components that were lacking happy-path tests.
  - `frontend/tests/ModernDocumentItem.ct.tsx` — New 750-line suite covering card/list view rendering (thumbnails, badges, metadata), selection state, permission-gated action buttons (CAN_UPDATE / read-only), action behaviors (view, edit, remove, open, download), backend-locked processing state, context menu actions, and version-history / relationship badges.
  - `frontend/tests/DocumentRelationshipModal.ct.tsx` — Extended suite now covers state transitions (moves / removes across columns), Add Source/Target search flow, label picker with pre-populated labels, label change, RELATIONSHIP and NOTES submit mutations, mutation failure handling, inline create-label flow, `SMART_LABEL_SEARCH_OR_CREATE`, the missing-corpus error state, and the useMemo filter bodies (`availableDocuments`, `filteredRelationshipLabels`).
  - `frontend/tests/DocumentRelationshipModalTestWrapper.tsx` — Added `makeMockRelationLabel` helper, `extraMocks` prop for per-test Apollo mocks, `relationLabels` / `withoutLabelset` / `corpusIdOverride` props, and a DRY `buildDocumentsMock()` factory (replaces duplicated mock blocks).
  - `frontend/tests/utils/ReactiveVarObserver.tsx` — New helper that exposes Apollo reactive-var state via DOM data attributes so Playwright assertions can observe cross-process (browser-side) state without reaching into the Node fixture.
  - Added workarounds for DndContext pointer-event interception (`clickViaReact` / `openContextMenu` using React 18 `__reactProps$` fiber access) with explicit upgrade-risk comments.
- **Route component and ExtractDetail view test coverage** (Issue #1285): Closed coverage gaps for zero-coverage route wrappers and the 7%-covered `ExtractDetail.tsx` orchestrator.
  - `frontend/src/components/routes/__tests__/ExtractDetailRoute.test.tsx` — 6 vitest specs covering missing-ID, reactive-var reuse, loading, error, not-found, and success paths for the slug-resolving extract route.
  - `frontend/src/components/routes/__tests__/ExtractLandingRoute.test.tsx` — 4 specs for the legacy `/e/:user/:extract` route, including the redirect to `/extracts/:id` when the reactive var is populated.
  - `frontend/src/components/routes/__tests__/LabelSetLandingRoute.test.tsx` — 5 specs for loading/error/success state and `onClose` cleanup.
  - `frontend/src/components/routes/__tests__/GlobalDiscussionsRoute.test.tsx` — smoke test for the thin route wrapper.
  - `frontend/src/components/routes/__tests__/NotFound.test.tsx` — renders 404 UI and verifies the "Go to Corpuses" button navigates back.
  - `frontend/src/components/routes/__tests__/UserProfileRoute.test.tsx` — 7 specs covering `/profile` redirects (anonymous → `/login`, logged-in → `/users/<slug>`), loading, error, not-found, and own-vs-other profile flags.
  - `frontend/tests/ExtractDetail.ct.tsx` + `ExtractDetailTestWrapper.tsx` + `ExtractDetailFixtures.ts` — 17 Playwright CT specs exercising the extract-detail view's header, status chips, StatBlocks, running/failed/completed state swaps, Data/Documents/Schema tabs, CreateColumnModal/ConfirmModal integration, and the Export-CSV enable/disable gating.
  - `frontend/tests/e2e/routing-round-trip.spec.ts` — Playwright E2E spec covering the URL → entity → back round-trip for corpuses, documents, deep-link replay, and the unknown-route `NotFound` fallback. Runs after the corpus-workflow spec so the necessary seed data exists.
  - Verification: 36 route vitest specs pass (`yarn test:unit --run src/components/routes/__tests__/`), 17 ExtractDetail CT specs pass (`yarn test:ct --reporter=list ExtractDetail.ct.tsx`), `tsc --noEmit` clean.
  - Surfaced Issue #1295 (UserProfileRoute Rules-of-Hooks violation) as a follow-up.

- **Frontend coverage: admin panel CT tests** (Issue #1281): Added 32 new Playwright component tests to close the coverage gap on the three admin-panel files called out in `docs/coverage/frontend-roi-ranking.md` (ranks 10, 24, 27).
  - `frontend/tests/pipeline-icons.ct.tsx` (+ `PipelineIconsTestWrapper.tsx`) — 5 tests covering `components/admin/PipelineIcons.tsx` (5.1% → target ≥60%). Mounts the full icon catalog (Docling, LlamaParse, TextParser, PdfThumbnail, TextThumbnail, ModernBert, SentenceTransformer, Multimodal, Generic), asserts brand icons render as `<img>` with alt text while inline SVG icons render as `<svg>`, verifies `size`/`className` prop forwarding, exhaustively exercises every branch of the `getComponentIcon` className dispatcher (including the compound `pdf+thumb`, `text+thumb`, and `modern_bert` patterns that must precede the single-token fallbacks), and covers `getComponentDisplayName` including the `title` override and `KNOWN_ACRONYMS` replacement path.
  - `frontend/tests/global-agent-management.ct.tsx` — 15 tests covering `components/admin/GlobalAgentManagement.tsx` (8.8% → target ≥60%). Adds loading/error states, list-rendering branches (missing slug, >3 tools with `+N` overflow badge, long-description truncation, inactive status), and full create/update/delete flows: submit-button disabling until required fields are filled, invalid-JSON `badgeConfig` validation toasts, successful create/update mutations with refetch, server-side `ok=false` error toasts, the `ConfirmModal` cancel path, and confirmed-delete mutation + refetch. Introduces a new `GlobalAgentManagementWithToastsWrapper` in `tests/AdminComponentsTestWrapper.tsx` that provides `ToastContainer` + `MemoryRouter` so tests can assert on react-toastify output without affecting pre-existing wrapper consumers.
  - `frontend/tests/system-settings-flows.ct.tsx` — 12 tests covering additional `components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx` flows not exercised by `admin-components.ct.tsx` (17.9% → target ≥60%): assigning/clearing parsers via the filetype-default dropdown, opening the Default Embedder modal and saving both list-selected and hand-typed class paths, non-secret config save (`num_workers` int + `verbose` bool select) through `AdvancedSettingsPanel`, mobile-tab keyboard navigation (`ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight`/`Home`/`End` including wrap-around), mutation error branches (network error toast + server-side `ok=false` message), and the `handleToggleEnabled` transition from empty `enabledComponents` ("all enabled") to an explicit list.
  - Verification: 77/77 tests pass (`yarn test:ct --reporter=list admin-components.ct.tsx pipeline-icons.ct.tsx global-agent-management.ct.tsx system-settings-flows.ct.tsx`) with no changes to pre-existing admin-components tests. `tsc --noEmit` and `prettier --check` clean.
- **Annotator hook / renderer / label-selector coverage** (Issue #1284): Added vitest coverage for the annotator hook layer plus Playwright CT coverage for the text and docx renderers and the enhanced label selector.

  - `frontend/src/components/annotator/hooks/__tests__/AnnotationHooks.test.tsx` — 25 tests covering state-wrapper helpers, guard clauses, success paths, and relation side effects. Includes a regression that keeps a sibling annotation in state across a `useUpdateAnnotation` call.
  - `frontend/tests/TxtAnnotator.ct.tsx`, `frontend/tests/DocxAnnotator.ct.tsx`, and `frontend/tests/EnhancedLabelSelector.ct.tsx` — CT suites driving prop-driven scenarios (visibility filtering, search highlights, chat sources, structural filtering, read-only mode).

- **Frontend component-test coverage for Corpus Chat & Agent Management** (Issue #1276): Added Playwright CT coverage for the four corpus components called out as the highest-uncovered surface area in `docs/coverage/frontend-roi-ranking.md` (CorpusChat, CreateCorpusActionModal, CorpusAgentManagement, CorpusDescriptionEditor — combined ~3,300 lines, ~2,800 previously uncovered).
  - `frontend/tests/CorpusChat.ct.tsx`: extended from 3 to 13 tests. Adds a Playwright `WebSocket` stub (mirroring the `ChatTray.ct.tsx` pattern) so we can drive ASYNC_START/CONTENT/FINISH, ASYNC_THOUGHT (with compaction notice), ASYNC_APPROVAL_NEEDED, ASYNC_APPROVAL_RESULT, ASYNC_ERROR (deferred via `setTimeout` to avoid being clobbered by the synchronous `setWsError(null)` after `socket.send`), and CONTEXT_EXHAUSTED. Covers approve/reject flows, context-meter rendering, send-button gating, conversation loading, navigation callbacks, and GraphQL error surface.
  - `frontend/tests/CorpusChatTestWrapper.tsx`: now sets `authToken`/`userObj` synchronously (matches `ChatTrayTestWrapper`) to avoid a re-mount race that closes the stub socket between renders. Forwards `initialQuery`, `onNavigateHome`, and `onMessageSelect` to the component.
  - `frontend/tests/CreateCorpusActionModal.ct.tsx` + `CreateCorpusActionModalTestWrapper.tsx`: 13 tests covering create/edit modes, modal open/close lifecycle, all three action types (fieldset/analyzer/agent), trigger-driven query switching (document tools vs. moderation tools), inline-vs-existing-agent toggle, validation toasts, Clear-All / Select-All tool toggles, and the create + update mutation happy paths.
  - `frontend/tests/CorpusAgentManagement.ct.tsx` + `CorpusAgentManagementTestWrapper.tsx`: 9 tests covering the `canUpdate=false` permission notice, empty state, agent row rendering with status badge and slug, create modal (with disabled-submit gating), edit modal pre-population, delete confirmation flow (yes / no), and the Permission Required Tools section unlocking when an available tool is selected.
  - `frontend/tests/CorpusDescriptionEditor.ct.tsx` + `CorpusDescriptionEditorTestWrapper.tsx`: 10 tests covering closed-modal behavior, fetching markdown via `page.route` interception, empty-corpus state, "Unsaved changes" indicator, Show/Hide history panel, version-row expansion + reapply mutation, edit-from-version state with badge, and unsaved-aware close.
  - All test wrappers mount a `<ToastContainer />` so `react-toastify` calls produce visible DOM in CT (Playwright `index.tsx` does not mount one globally).
  - Verification: 45/45 new + updated tests pass via `yarn test:ct CorpusChat.ct.tsx CreateCorpusActionModal.ct.tsx CorpusAgentManagement.ct.tsx CorpusDescriptionEditor.ct.tsx --reporter=list`; `tsc --noEmit` clean on the new files.

### Added

- **Extracts DataGrid & Detail component test coverage** (Issue #1282): Expanded Playwright component tests for the two biggest uncovered files in `frontend/src/components/extracts/`. Previously at 32.5% and 23.0% line coverage respectively (~990 uncovered lines combined); the new tests exercise the high-signal branches listed in the issue.
  - `frontend/tests/DataGrid.ct.tsx`: grew from 4 to 19 tests. New coverage: loading overlay (idle vs running copy), Document/column sort toggles, row-selection bulk-delete bar + callback, add-column modal, per-column edit modal, per-column delete confirmation (including the `fieldset.inUse` warning copy), add-documents FAB, a 4-type cell-rendering matrix (text/number/boolean/JSON object), corrected-data precedence, and `exportToCsv` via the imperative handle.
  - `frontend/tests/ExtractDetailContent.ct.tsx` + `frontend/tests/ExtractDetailContentTestWrapper.tsx` (both new): 16 tests covering the loading overlay, not-found state, stats panel, Data/Documents/Schema tabs, running-state spinner, failed-state Retry button + `startExtract` mutation, schema tab empty-vs-populated + Add Column + Delete Column confirmation, Documents tab empty state, and both imperative-handle methods (`exportToCsv`, `startExtract`) plus the `onExtractLoaded` callback.
  - `frontend/tests/DataGridTestWrapper.tsx`: added optional callback-spy props (`onAddDocIds`, `onRemoveDocIds`, `onRemoveColumnId`, `onAddColumn`) and a `withExportButton` flag that renders a test-only button bound to the grid's imperative `exportToCsv` handle, so tests can verify the handle without reaching into internal refs.

- **Frontend coverage tests for useAgentChat / LabelSetDetailPage / ModerationDashboard** (Issue #1286): Added 47 new tests lifting the three high-ROI files from ~11–28% line coverage toward the ≥60% target.
  - `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useAgentChat.test.tsx` — 23 new Vitest unit tests wiring a mock `WebSocket` through `renderHook`. Cover connection lifecycle (open, error, close), every streaming message type (`ASYNC_START`, `ASYNC_CONTENT`, `ASYNC_FINISH`, `ASYNC_THOUGHT`, `ASYNC_SOURCES`, `ASYNC_APPROVAL_NEEDED`, `ASYNC_APPROVAL_RESULT`, `ASYNC_RESUME`, `ASYNC_ERROR`, `SYNC_CONTENT`), malformed JSON handling, approval flow including `sendApprovalDecision`, `sendMessage` guards (empty, disconnected, while-processing, send-throws), `clearError`, and `setSelectedMessageId`. Local coverage now 82.9% lines for `useAgentChat.ts`.
  - `frontend/tests/LabelSetDetailPage.coverage.ct.tsx` — 15 new Playwright CT tests covering previously-uncovered mutation success paths: `UPDATE_ANNOTATION_LABEL` inline edit save, `CREATE_ANNOTATION_LABEL_FOR_LABELSET` submission, `DELETE_MULTIPLE_ANNOTATION_LABELS` delete flow, `DELETE_LABELSET` confirm modal → Yes → mutation, `handleExportJSON` blob download handler, Overview tab Delete button (visible/hidden per permission), Edit Details footer button visibility, Relationships / Doc Labels / Sharing tabs, error state when the query fails, and the empty-state "Add First Label" branch.
  - `frontend/tests/ModerationDashboard.coverage.ct.tsx` — 9 new Playwright CT tests: `ROLLBACK_MODERATION_ACTION` mutation with reason, action-type filter refetch, automated-only toggle refetch, time-range dropdown change refetch, `Load More` cursor pagination via `fetchMore`, actions-query error state, metrics-query error state, rollback-modal cancel, and the System / "No reason provided" rendering branches.
  - **Issue #1296 discovered and filed**: `useAgentChat.ts:810` includes `pendingApproval` in the main WebSocket `useEffect` dependency array, so the socket tears down + reconnects every time approval state changes. This drops in-flight tokens and can race `sendApprovalDecision` against `isConnected=false` during reconnect. A regression test in `useAgentChat.test.tsx` documents the current behaviour; the workaround comments reference #1296 so they can be removed after the fix lands.

- **Codecov components for backend and frontend** (`.codecov.yml`): Added `component_management` with two components — Backend (`opencontractserver/**`, `config/**`) and Frontend (`frontend/src/**`) — grouping all five flags so PR comments and the Codecov UI show a single frontend number (union of unit + component + e2e) instead of five overlapping flag numbers. Component-level patch/project statuses now gate PRs per-area.
- **Frontend coverage ROI audit** (`docs/coverage/frontend-roi-ranking.md`): Ranked every frontend source file by uncovered line count against the Codecov project-level (flag-union) report. Top 50 files, files at 0% coverage with >=100 lines, and per-area totals. Source for prioritizing targeted coverage work.
- **Frontend error-path test coverage** (Issue #1270): Added targeted unit tests covering error boundaries, the Apollo error link, and `catch` blocks in utility modules. Previously these branches were effectively untested, leaving regressions in auth error handling, file download failures, and error boundary fallback UI undetectable in CI.
  - `frontend/src/components/widgets/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` — 7 new tests for `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: default fallback UI on child-thrown errors, `onError` callback invocation, console logging in `componentDidCatch`, custom `fallback` render prop, recovery via the reset button, and persistent error state when the child keeps throwing.
  - `frontend/src/graphql/errorLink.test.ts` — Rewrote the existing smoke test (which only toggled reactive vars) into a full suite that executes the real `errorLink` through an `ApolloLink.from([errorLink, terminating])` chain. Now asserts all auth-error branches (401/403/`UNAUTHENTICATED`, message-based detection, JWT-expired reload via `setTimeout` + `window.location.reload`), the non-auth logging fall-through, and both network-error branches (401/403 vs generic).
  - `frontend/src/utils/__tests__/files.test.ts` — Added tests for `downloadFile` success path (axios → Blob → anchor click) and its `catch (e)` branch (rejects with the original error and logs before re-throwing), plus `toBase64` success and `FileReader.onerror` rejection path.
  - `frontend/src/utils/graphqlGuards.test.ts` — Added explicit coverage for `createSafeQueryExecutor`'s `catch (error)` branch (line 129, logs via `console.error` and surfaces the error) and the validation-blocked `console.warn` branch.
  - Verification: 49/49 new + updated tests pass via `yarn vitest run` on all four files; `tsc --noEmit` and `prettier --check` both clean.

### Fixed

- **`PdfAnnotations.undoAnnotation()` mutated the caller's annotations array** (Issue #1291): `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/annotations.ts:311` called `this.annotations.pop()` before constructing the new `PdfAnnotations`, silently shortening the original instance's `annotations` array even though the field is declared `readonly`. This violated the immutability contract the other methods (`saved()`, `update()`, `fromObject()`) uphold and is a footgun for the upcoming PdfAnnotator package extraction (#1283) — any consumer holding a reference to the pre-undo instance would see a stale length without a state change. The method now derives `popped` via index access and `remaining` via `slice(0, -1)`, so the caller's array is untouched. The pinning test in `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/__tests__/annotations.test.ts` was updated to assert non-mutation (`pdf.annotations` stays `[a, b]` after `pdf.undoAnnotation()`), and the "known wrinkle" comment was removed.

### Removed

- **Frontend dead Jotai atoms and Apollo reactive vars** (Issue #1243): Removed unused state management exports after triple-verifying each against both `frontend/src/` and `frontend/tests/` — atoms consumed only by test wrappers (e.g. `hideLabelsAtom`, `rawPermissionsAtom`, the deprecated `showAnnotation*Atom` set) were left in place per the issue's scope-correction note.
  - **`frontend/src/atoms/folderAtoms.ts`**: Removed 8 unused exports — `currentFolderAtom` (only read by the two dead permission atoms below), `canUpdateCurrentFolderAtom`, `canDeleteCurrentFolderAtom`, `draggingDocumentIdAtom`, `enableDragDropAtom`, `collapseAllFoldersAtom`, `expandAllFoldersAtom`, `openMoveFolderModalAtom`.
  - **`frontend/src/atoms/threadAtoms.ts`**: Removed 5 unused atoms — `selectedCorpusIdAtom`, `currentThreadIdAtom`, `expandedMessageIdsAtom`, `showCreateThreadModalAtom`, `editingMessageIdAtom` — plus the unused `ConversationType` / `ChatMessageType` imports. Unexported the `ThreadFilterOptions` type since it is only used internally by `threadFiltersAtom`.
  - **`frontend/src/components/annotator/context/DocumentAtom.tsx`**: Removed 7 unused atoms and 7 unused hooks: `fileTypeAtom` + `useFileType`, `isLoadingAtom` + `useIsLoading`, `canUpdateDocumentAtom` + `useCanUpdateDocument`, `canDeleteDocumentAtom` + `useCanDeleteDocument`, `hasDocumentPermissionAtom` + `useHasDocumentPermission`, `pageSelectionAtom`, `pageSelectionQueueAtom` + `usePageSelectionQueue`, plus the dead `useViewState` and `usePermissions` hooks (the underlying `viewStateAtom` and `permissionsAtom` are kept because they remain live via `useSetViewStateError` / `useDocumentPermissions` respectively). Dropped the now-unused `BoundingBox` import.
  - **`frontend/src/components/annotator/context/UISettingsAtom.tsx`**: Removed `hasScrolledToAnnotationAtom` (zero references anywhere in the tree).
  - **`frontend/src/graphql/cache.ts`**: Removed 7 unused reactive vars — `addingColumnToExtract`, `editingColumnForExtract`, `editingExtract`, `analyzerSearchTerm`, `editMode`, `allowUserInput`, `filterToAnnotationLabelId` — plus the now-unused `ColumnType` import. Unexported the `LinkDocumentsModalState` interface since it is only used internally as the type argument for `linkDocumentsModalState`.
  - Verification: `tsc --noEmit` passes, `vitest run` passes (935/935 unit tests).

- **Frontend dead styled components in `knowledge_base/document/styled/`** (Issue #1241): Removed unused styled-components from the `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/styled/` folder. None of the deleted exports are referenced by any production code, test wrapper, or `.ct.tsx` test:
  - **`Relationships.tsx` deleted entirely** — all 3 exports (`RelationshipPanel`, `RelationshipCard`, `RelationshipType`) were unused. Note: a GraphQL type with the same name `RelationshipType` lives in `types/graphql-api.ts` and is unaffected.
  - **`LoadingStates.tsx`**: removed `DocumentLoadingContainer` (truly dead — no internal or external use). The other exports (`PlaceholderBase`, `PlaceholderItem`, `SummaryPlaceholder`, `NotePlaceholder`, `RelationshipPlaceholder`) are kept because they are used internally by `LoadingPlaceholders` in the same file.
  - **`RightPanel.tsx`**: removed 5 unused exports (`ControlButtonGroupLeft`, `ControlButtonWrapper`, `ControlButton`, `ChatIndicator`, `ControlButtonGroup`). Kept the only consumed exports: `ConnectionStatus` and `SlidingPanel`.
  - **`styled/index.ts`** barrel pruned to drop the dead re-exports listed above.
  - Verification: `yarn build` succeeds, `yarn test:unit` passes (927/927), `yarn test:ct -g "DocumentKnowledgeBase" --reporter=list` passes (62/62).
  - **Deferred to a follow-up**: dead exports in `ResizeControls.tsx` (`ResizeHandleControl`, `ResizeHandleButton`, `WidthControlBar`, `WidthControlMenu`, `WidthControlToggle`, `WidthButton`, `AutoMinimizeToggle`) — although these are also unreferenced anywhere in the tree, deleting them deterministically exposes a pre-existing race in `tests/DocumentKnowledgeBase.ct.tsx:348 "fullscreen modal covers the entire viewport"` when the suite runs in parallel. The test passes in isolation but fails in the full suite, suggesting the deletion shifts bundle ordering enough to alter timing for the modal mount/measure window. Will be addressed in a separate PR that either patches the test to wait for the modal animation to settle, or finds the underlying race.

- **Frontend dead code cleanup, pass 1** (Issue #1240): Deleted 13 unreachable source files identified by static reachability analysis from `App.tsx`/`index.tsx` and the test entry points. No production importers and no test importers exist for any of these files:
  - Hooks orphaned by refactors: `frontend/src/hooks/useThreadWebSocket.ts` (thread real-time streaming via `ws/thread-updates/` was never wired into any thread component; the backend consumer exists but the frontend hook had no importers — see Issues #623, #697 for future work), `frontend/src/hooks/useUrlAnnotationSync.ts` (the latter was already documented as removed in a comment at `DocumentKnowledgeBase.tsx:1858` but the file itself was never deleted; the stale comment is also removed)
  - Duplicate styled helpers: `frontend/src/components/common.tsx` (duplicated `VerticallyCenteredDiv`/`SidebarContainer` from `components/layout/Wrappers.tsx`) and `frontend/src/components/annotator/common.tsx` (only consumed by the dead file above; also contained a `console.log` that would have appeared in production builds)
  - Dead types: `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/ui.ts` (unused `TabVisibility`) and `frontend/src/components/annotator/renderers/txt/types.ts` (duplicate stub of `MultipageAnnotationJson`; the real one lives in `components/annotator/types/annotations.ts`)
  - Dead barrels (every consumer imports inner files directly, never through these): `frontend/src/components/widgets/icon-picker/index.ts`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusAbout/index.ts`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome/index.ts` (file `CorpusHome.tsx` shadows the directory in Node module resolution), `frontend/src/components/corpuses/caml/index.ts`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/folders/index.ts`
  - Dead utility: `frontend/src/utils/history.ts` (`createBrowserHistory()` singleton, never imported)
  - Dead mock factory file: `frontend/src/tests/utils/factories.ts` (mock GraphQL response factories with no consumers; its parent directory `src/tests/` is also removed since it's now empty)
  - Updated documentation referencing deleted `useThreadWebSocket`: removed hook section and references from `docs/architecture/websocket/frontend.md`, annotated implementation plan entries in `docs/features/agent_mentions_implementation_plan.md`, removed row from `docs/commenting_system/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
  - Verification: `yarn build` succeeds, all 927 unit tests pass (`yarn test:unit`), and the 16 icon picker component tests still pass (`IconDropdown`, `IconPickerModal`, and `icons.ts` are kept because they have full Playwright `.ct.tsx` test suites in `frontend/tests/`)

### Added

- **Benchmark harness for external RAG datasets** (new app `opencontractserver/benchmarks/`): Generate an OpenContracts corpus from a third-party benchmark (LegalBench-RAG today, pluggable for CUAD/MAUD/etc. via a small adapter interface), run the production extract-grid pipeline against the benchmark's queries with a configurable LLM, probe retrieval independently via `CoreAnnotationVectorStore`, and compute standard metrics (SQuAD-style exact match / token F1 for answers; character-span recall@k / precision@k / IoU for retrieval). Results are written as `report.json` / `report.csv` / `config.json` / `gold.json` under a run directory.
  - Adapter interface and `LegalBenchRAGAdapter` at `opencontractserver/benchmarks/adapters/` (reads the authoritative ZeroEntropy schema — `{"tests": [{"query", "snippets": [{"file_path", "span": [start, end]}], "tags"}]}`)
  - Loader, runner, evaluator, and report modules under `opencontractserver/benchmarks/`
  - Django management command: `python manage.py run_benchmark --benchmark legalbench-rag --path /data/legalbench-rag --user admin --model openai:gpt-4o-mini --top-k 10`
  - Micro fixture under `fixtures/benchmarks/legalbench_rag_micro/` for end-to-end tests without downloading the full dataset
  - Test coverage: `opencontractserver/tests/test_benchmarks.py` (metric unit tests, adapter unit tests, loader materialization test, runner end-to-end test with mocked structured-response agent)
- **`model_override` kwarg on `doc_extract_query_task`** (`opencontractserver/tasks/data_extract_tasks.py`): Optional, backward-compatible kwarg that lets callers override the hardcoded `openai:gpt-4o-mini` default for a single invocation. Consumed by the benchmark runner to sweep models without affecting production defaults; still defaults to `openai:gpt-4o-mini` when not supplied.
- **Frontend unit tests for utils and hooks** (Issue #1267): Added 14 new `*.test.ts(x)` files covering previously-untested utilities and hooks to raise `frontend-unit` coverage on high-ROI pure functions:
  - **Utils**: `formatters.test.ts`, `arrayUtils.test.ts`, `colorUtils.test.ts`, `parseOutputType.test.ts`, `annotationGuards.test.ts`, `env.test.ts`, `extractUtils.test.ts`, `layout.test.ts`, `persistentVar.test.ts`, `routingLogger.test.ts`, `navigationCircuitBreaker.test.ts`, `performance.test.ts`, `jobNotificationCacheUpdates.test.ts`, `compactAnnotationJson.test.ts`.
  - **Hooks**: `useAuthReady.test.tsx`, `useFeatureAvailability.test.ts`, `useMessageBadges.test.tsx`, `useBadgeCelebration.test.tsx` (render-hook based with vi.useFakeTimers/MockedProvider).
  - Adds ~210 new assertions across file-size/date/initial formatting, hex→RGB(A) conversions, Pydantic output-type parsing, per-annotation runtime guards, runtime env coercion, extract status, viewport clamping, session-storage-backed reactive vars, debug logger toggling, navigation circuit breaker tripping/reset/window pruning, performance monitor metric lifecycle, Apollo cache field-level mutation dispatch for job notifications, and v1↔v2 compact annotation JSON round-tripping.
  - Verification: full unit suite passes (1118/1118) and `tsc --noEmit` is clean.

- **Unit tests for Jotai atoms and Apollo reactive vars** (Issue #1268): Added vitest coverage for the global state layer per the ROI audit in PR #1266.
  - **`frontend/src/atoms/__tests__/folderAtoms.test.ts`**: 46 tests covering every primitive atom (initial value + write), every derived atom (`folderTreeAtom`, `folderBreadcrumbAtom`, `folderMapAtom`, `canCreateFoldersAtom`) across multiple dependency states, every write-only action atom (toggle/expand/open/close helpers), and `atomWithStorage` persistence paths (Set ↔ JSON round-trip, malformed-JSON fallback, SSR-safe `sidebarCollapsedAtom` default for mobile vs desktop viewports).
  - **`frontend/src/atoms/__tests__/threadAtoms.test.ts`**: 9 tests covering all five atoms plus a localStorage round-trip and re-hydration path for `threadContextSidebarExpandedAtom`.
  - **`frontend/src/graphql/__tests__/cache.test.ts`**: 24 tests covering initial values of every reactive var exported from `cache.ts` (routing, modals, entity refs, search terms, collections), round-trip writes for representative vars, `mergeArrayByIdFieldPolicy` id-based merge + default-empty branches, `InMemoryCache` presence, and `showKnowledgeBaseModal` (`persistentVar`) first-write persistence, re-hydration from sessionStorage, and malformed-JSON fallback.
  - Coverage (v8 provider): `src/atoms` → 99.23% statements / 93.54% branches; `frontend/src/graphql/cache.ts` → 95.6% statements / 100% branches. Well above the 80% target in the issue.
  - Verification: all 79 new tests green; full unit suite (1014/1014) still passes; `tsc --noEmit` clean.

- **Frontend permission-gating tests** (Issue #1269): Added branch-exhaustive coverage for the permission predicates that gate annotation write UI.
  - New utility `frontend/src/utils/annotationPermissions.ts` centralizes three pure predicates (`canEditAnnotationsInCorpus`, `canDeleteAnnotation`, `canUpdateAnnotation`) that were previously inlined in `DocumentKnowledgeBase.tsx:471` and `HighlightItem.tsx:242`. Both consumers now delegate to the helper, eliminating duplicated logic.
  - New unit tests `frontend/src/utils/__tests__/annotationPermissions.test.ts` cover every branch of the predicates, including the full 2×2 truth table for the corpus/document effective-edit check and the full 2³ truth table for the structural × read-only × `CAN_REMOVE` delete gate (30 assertions).
  - New Playwright CT tests `frontend/tests/HighlightItemPermissions.ct.tsx` (+ harness `HighlightItemPermissionsTestWrapper.tsx`) verify that the sidebar delete affordance renders only on the intersection of the required conditions, and that structural annotations are delete-locked even with `CAN_REMOVE` (6 scenarios).
  - Production behavior is unchanged — the helper is a faithful extraction of the existing inline logic.

- **Frontend E2E integration tests with coverage**: Added a Playwright integration spec (`frontend/tests/e2e/login-and-navigation.spec.ts`) that exercises the full Vite + Django + Postgres stack. The spec logs in via the password form against a real backend and walks every routed view in `src/views/` (Discovery, Corpuses, Documents, LabelSets, Annotations, Extracts, GlobalDiscussions, ThreadSearchRoute, PrivacyPolicy, TermsOfService, UserProfile, Login). New supporting files:
  - `frontend/tests/e2e/fixtures.ts` — Playwright fixture that dumps `window.__coverage__` to `frontend/coverage/e2e/.nyc_output/` after every test (mirrors the CT pattern in `tests/utils/coverage.ts`).
  - `frontend/tests/e2e/helpers.ts` — `VIEWS` catalog, `loginViaUI`, `spaNavigate`, and `expectViewVisible` helpers. Uses `history.pushState` + `popstate` dispatch for SPA navigation so the in-memory `authToken` reactive var survives between routes.
  - `frontend/playwright.config.ts` — Rewritten to manage a `webServer` block that boots vite with `COVERAGE=true` and `REACT_APP_USE_AUTH0=false`, runs the chromium project against `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, and matches `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts` (existing `*.spec.tsx` files under `tests/` keep running inside the CT runner).
  - `frontend/package.json` — New `test:e2e:coverage` script that runs the spec with Istanbul instrumentation and merges the per-test JSON dumps into `coverage/e2e/lcov.info` via `nyc report`.
  - `.github/workflows/frontend-e2e.yml` — New CI job that builds the django image from `test.yml`, brings up postgres + redis + django with `--no-deps` (skipping the multi-GB parser/embedder images), waits on `/api/health/`, verifies migration `0003_create_initial_superuser` produced the `admin` user, then runs `yarn test:e2e:coverage` and uploads the lcov to Codecov under the `frontend-e2e` flag.
  - `.codecov.yml` — Declared the `frontend-e2e` flag with `paths: [frontend/src/]` and `carryforward: true` so the E2E upload participates in project coverage aggregation alongside `frontend-unit` and `frontend-component`. Without this declaration the flag was accepted by Codecov but not aggregated into the main-branch project total, which is why coverage did not visibly rise after PR #1251 merged.
- **Bounded `fullDatacellList` payload for extract grid embeds** (Issue #1204): `ExtractType.fullDatacellList` now accepts optional `limit` and `offset` arguments, and a new `ExtractType.datacellCount` field returns the total visible datacell count ignoring pagination. Resolver `resolve_full_datacell_list` applies a deterministic `order_by("document_id", "column_id", "id")` before slicing so limits/offsets produce stable windows across requests (`config/graphql/extract_types.py`, `schema.graphql`). Frontend `GET_EXTRACT_GRID_EMBED` (`frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`) now passes `limit: EXTRACT_GRID_EMBED_CELL_LIMIT` (500) and fetches `datacellCount`; `ExtractGridEmbed` (`frontend/src/components/extracts/ExtractGridEmbed.tsx`) renders a "Showing N of M cells" / "Showing N of M documents" partial-data footer instead of the previous hard "exceeds limit" error screen. Adds the `EXTRACT_GRID_EMBED_CELL_LIMIT` constant (`frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts`), a new `partial` state to `ExtractGridEmbedTestWrapper`, and backend coverage in `test_extract_queries.py::test_full_datacell_list_limit_offset_and_count`.

- **Agent memory system**: Per-corpus memory that lets agents accumulate reusable insights from conversations. Memory is stored as a first-class markdown Document in the corpus (visible and editable by users). Features include:
  - Corpus model fields: `memory_enabled` toggle and `memory_document` FK (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`)
  - Memory CRUD utilities with hybrid retrieval (full injection for small memory, keyword-scored section filtering for large) (`opencontractserver/agents/memory.py`)
  - End-of-conversation curation via two-stage Celery task: privacy-preserving summarisation followed by LLM-based pattern extraction (`opencontractserver/tasks/memory_tasks.py`)
  - Automatic memory injection into agent system prompts via `UnifiedAgentFactory` (`opencontractserver/llms/agents/agent_factory.py`)
  - New agent tools: `get_corpus_memory` (read) and `suggest_memory_update` (write) (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools.py`)
  - GraphQL `ToggleCorpusMemory` mutation and `memoryActiveWarning` field with privacy notice (`config/graphql/corpus_mutations.py`, `config/graphql/corpus_types.py`)
  - Periodic Celery beat task to detect idle conversations eligible for curation (`config/settings/base.py`)
  - Constants and configuration in `opencontractserver/constants/agent_memory.py`
- **Frontend code coverage reporting** (PR #1205): Added coverage collection and Codecov integration for both unit tests (Vitest + v8) and component tests (Playwright CT + Istanbul). Coverage is opt-in via `COVERAGE=true` environment variable to avoid performance overhead during normal test runs. Custom Playwright fixture (`frontend/tests/utils/coverage.ts`) extracts Istanbul `__coverage__` data from the browser after each test. CI uploads separate coverage flags (`frontend-unit`, `frontend-component`) with `carryforward: true` for granular tracking. Added `.codecov.yml` configuration, `vite-plugin-istanbul` for build-time instrumentation, and `nyc` for LCOV report generation from collected coverage data.

### Fixed

- **Rules-of-Hooks violation in `UserProfileRoute`** (Issue #1295): `frontend/src/components/routes/UserProfileRoute.tsx` called `useQuery` _after_ a conditional early return for the `!slug` redirect case, so when the same component fiber was reused across the `/profile` → `/users/:slug` redirect (e.g. both routes rendering `UserProfileRoute` in a single `Routes` tree) React threw `Rendered more hooks than during the previous render`. Production flows that unmount/remount across the redirect masked the bug, but any future refactor that kept the fiber alive would start crashing, and test suites that mounted both routes together could not exercise the full redirect → render path. Moved `useQuery` above the early-return block and pass `{ slug: slug ?? "" }` as variables while keeping the existing `skip: !slug` gate on the network call.
- **`PdfAnnotations.undoAnnotation()` mutated the source array** (Issue #1291): `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/annotations.ts` called `this.annotations.pop()` before constructing the returned instance, silently mutating the caller's `annotations` array even though the field is declared `readonly`. Every other method on this reducer-style class returns without touching the input, so the leak was a footgun for downstream consumers of the upcoming PdfAnnotator package extraction (Issue #1283) — any reference to the pre-undo instance would observe a stale shorter array without re-rendering. Replaced `.pop()` with a non-mutating `slice(0, -1)` + index read. Updated `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/__tests__/annotations.test.ts` to remove the pinning comment and add an explicit assertion that the original instance's `annotations` array is unchanged after `undoAnnotation()`.
- **`RelationGroup.updateForAnnotationDeletion` never pruned orphaned relations** (Issue #1292): `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/annotations.ts:49-50` computed `nowSourceEmpty` / `nowTargetEmpty` against `this.sourceIds` / `this.targetIds` (the **pre-filter** arrays) instead of the `newSourceIds` / `newTargetIds` arrays produced a few lines above. Because the "now empty" flags were identical to the "was empty" flags, all four `return undefined` branches intended to prune orphaned relations were unreachable, and the method always returned a fresh `RelationGroup` — even when `PdfAnnotations.undoAnnotation()` had just removed the relation's only source or target annotation. That left zombie relations in `PdfAnnotations.relations` with empty `sourceIds` or `targetIds` and required defensive handling downstream. Fix swaps the two comparisons to the post-filter arrays so the documented deletion conditions fire correctly. `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/__tests__/annotations.test.ts` drops the bug-pinning header note and replaces the ambiguous "prunes any relations" assertion with two explicit cases: the survivor is kept when it still has a source and a target, and a relation whose only target references the popped annotation is now removed (21/21 unit tests pass).
- **O(N) query regression in bulk folder operations** (Issue #1199): `DocumentFolderService.move_documents_to_folder()` and `DocumentFolderService.delete_folder()` in `opencontractserver/corpuses/folder_service.py` previously issued ~3 DB round-trips per document (an EXISTS-style disambiguation fetch, an `UPDATE` via `save(update_fields=…)`, and an `INSERT` via `DocumentPath.objects.create()`). For a 100-document batch that was ~300 queries instead of the single-query `.update()` the old non-lineage code used. Both methods now:
  1. Pre-fetch all occupied paths in the target directory in a **single** query via the new `_fetch_occupied_paths_in_directory` helper and pass the shared mutable set to `_disambiguate_path` via a new `occupied_override` parameter (replaces the single-purpose `extra_occupied` kwarg).
  2. Batch-deactivate every superseded `DocumentPath` row with one `.filter(pk__in=…).update(is_current=False)` call.
  3. Batch-insert every successor row with one `.bulk_create()` call, then manually dispatch `post_save` (`created=True`) via the new `_dispatch_document_path_created_signals` helper so the document-text embedding side effect wired up in `documents/signals.py::process_doc_on_document_path_create` still fires (bulk_create normally bypasses per-row signals).
  4. Use `select_related("document")` + `select_for_update(of=("self",))` on the affected-path query so `current.document` accesses inside the build loop no longer N+1, and the row lock stays scoped to the `DocumentPath` table. Net result: a 100-document bulk move now executes roughly 4 DB round-trips instead of ~300, and the old batched `.update()` performance is restored without sacrificing the Path Tree history nodes introduced in PR #1195.
- **TOCTOU race on `DocumentPath` uniqueness** (Issue #1200): `DocumentFolderService.move_document_to_folder()`, `move_documents_to_folder()`, and `delete_folder()` previously caught `IntegrityError` from the `unique_active_path_per_corpus` partial unique constraint and either bubbled it up to the caller as a "Path conflict, please retry" error (single move) or rolled back the entire batch (bulk move / folder delete). Under concurrent moves of different documents to the same target folder, two transactions could both observe a candidate path as free in `_disambiguate_path()` and race to insert it; the loser hit the partial unique index and the operation failed. New helper `DocumentFolderService._create_successor_path_with_retry()` (`opencontractserver/corpuses/folder_service.py`) wraps the deactivate-then-create pair in a savepoint and retries with a freshly disambiguated path on `IntegrityError`, treating each losing path as occupied. Up to `MAX_PATH_CREATE_RETRIES + 1` attempts (`opencontractserver/constants/document_processing.py`) run before propagating the conflict. The partial unique index added in migration `0023_documentpath_documentpathgroupobjectpermission_and_more` remains the authoritative correctness guarantee. Test class `TestMoveDocumentIntegrityRecovery` covers single-document transient-failure recovery, disambiguated retry path selection, and exhausted-retry rollback. Bulk operations (`move_documents_to_folder`, `delete_folder`) now use the batch approach from Issue #1199 instead of per-row retry, so their former test classes (`TestBulkMoveIntegrityRecovery`, `TestDeleteFolderIntegrityRecovery`) have been replaced by `TestCoverageGapBulkMoveIntegrityErrorRollback` and `TestCoverageGapDeleteFolderIntegrityErrorRollback` which verify full-batch rollback on `IntegrityError` (`opencontractserver/tests/test_document_folder_service.py`).
- **Bulk move loop recomputed target folder path per document** (Issue #1202): `DocumentFolderService.move_documents_to_folder()` (`opencontractserver/corpuses/folder_service.py`) called `_compute_moved_path()` once per document, and each call invoked `target_folder.get_path()` — which walks ancestors via a recursive CTE query. For an N-document bulk move to the same folder, this issued N redundant CTE queries for an O(1) value. The target folder path is now resolved once before the loop and threaded through `_compute_moved_path()` via a new optional `target_folder_path` parameter.
- **Backend coverage disappearing from Codecov dashboard** (`.codecov.yml`): Added a `backend` flag with `carryforward: true` (paths: `opencontractserver/`, `config/`), mirroring the pattern already in place for `frontend-unit` / `frontend-component`. Without carryforward, any commit whose backend `pytest` job fails or times out (e.g. the merge commit `f166a59`, where the push-to-main `pytest` check failed after PR #1213 merged) causes Codecov to record backend files at 0% for that commit, which then replaces the healthy ~90% backend coverage on the dashboard — making it look as if only frontend coverage (~39%) is being collected. With carryforward, a flaky/failing backend run inherits the parent commit's backend coverage so the dashboard continues to reflect both suites.
- **IngestionSource follow-up hardening** (Issue #1228):
  - Added `@graphql_ratelimit` to `CreateIngestionSourceMutation`, `UpdateIngestionSourceMutation`, and `DeleteIngestionSourceMutation` (`config/graphql/ingestion_source_mutations.py`). Previously these mutations only carried `@login_required`, allowing an authenticated user to create thousands of rows (plus Guardian permission entries) in a tight loop. Creates/updates use `WRITE_MEDIUM`, deletes use `WRITE_LIGHT`, matching other CRUD mutations in the codebase.
  - Guarded the fallback `.get()` inside the `except IntegrityError` handler in `_import_ingestion_sources` (`opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks_v2.py` ~line 463). In the rare scenario where a concurrent request created-then-deleted the row between the `IntegrityError` and the fallback, the unguarded `.get()` would raise `IngestionSource.DoesNotExist` and abort the entire corpus import. Now logs a warning and continues.
  - Added an explicit `fields` allowlist to `IngestionSourceType.Meta` (`config/graphql/document_types.py`) to prevent `user_lock`, `backend_lock`, and `is_public` from leaking through the GraphQL API. `user_lock` in particular would leak the username of whoever currently holds the lock — an information-disclosure issue.
  - Added a clarifying comment documenting the intentional export/import asymmetry for `ingestion_metadata` in `_reconstruct_document_paths` (`opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks_v2.py`).

- **Document lineage fields dropped on move/delete/restore** (PR #1197): `move_document`, `delete_document`, and `restore_document` in `opencontractserver/documents/versioning.py` now forward `ingestion_source`, `external_id`, and `ingestion_metadata` from the parent path record to newly-created path nodes. Previously these fields were silently dropped, losing lineage provenance on any path operation.

- **`ingestion_metadata` truthiness check** (PR #1197): Changed `if ingestion_metadata:` to `if ingestion_metadata is not None:` in `config/graphql/document_mutations.py` so that an empty dict `{}` is correctly stored rather than silently discarded.

- **Lazy logging in export_v2.py** (PR #1197): Replaced remaining f-string logger calls with `%s`-style lazy formatting in `opencontractserver/utils/export_v2.py` for corpus folders, relationships, conversations, structural annotations, and markdown description error handlers.

- **TOCTOU race in `_import_ingestion_sources`** (PR #1197): Wrapped `get_or_create` in `transaction.atomic()` savepoint so that an `IntegrityError` from a concurrent insert doesn't abort the outer PostgreSQL transaction, which would cause the fallback `.get()` to raise `TransactionManagementError`.

- **`DRFMutation` validation error formatting extracted** (PR #1197): Extracted inline validation-error formatting logic from `DRFMutation.mutate()` into a reusable `format_validation_error()` static method (`config/graphql/base.py`). Updated `TestDRFMutationValidationError` tests to call the real method instead of duplicating the logic inline.

- **Renamed `EXPECTED_GLOBAL_ID_TYPE` to `INGESTION_SOURCE_GLOBAL_ID_TYPE`** (PR #1197): Renamed the generic constant to be self-documenting across `config/graphql/document_types.py`, `document_queries.py`, `document_mutations.py`, and `ingestion_source_mutations.py`.

- **Conversation pagination cache collisions** (PR #1206): Added `keyArgs` configuration for the `conversations` relay pagination cache entry in `frontend/src/graphql/cache.ts`. Previously `conversations` used `relayStylePagination()` with no key arguments, causing all conversation queries (across different corpora, documents, and conversation types) to share a single cache entry. This led to paginated results from one context bleeding into another. Now uses `["documentId", "corpusId", "conversationType", "hasCorpus", "hasDocument"]` to isolate cache entries by filter dimensions.

- **GraphQL security hardening cleanup** (Issue #1198):
  - Corrected misleading `DisableIntrospection` docstring that claimed the class checks DEBUG, when it unconditionally blocks introspection (`config/graphql/security.py`)
  - Rewrote `test_introspection_allowed_in_debug` to use graphql-core's `validate()` directly, as graphene's test Client does not apply validation rules (`opencontractserver/tests/test_security_hardening.py`)
  - Added backslash-prefix check to `_get_safe_redirect_url()` to prevent open-redirect bypass via browser backslash-to-slash normalization (`config/admin_auth/views.py`)

- **Batch embedding cleanup** (Issue #1226): Follow-up on PR #1148:
  - Added backward-compatible re-exports of `EmbeddingClientError` / `EmbeddingServerError` from `opencontractserver/pipeline/embedders/multimodal_microservice.py` so external embedders that imported the symbols from their original module keep working. Canonical location remains `opencontractserver.pipeline.base.exceptions`.
  - `EmbeddingClientError` is now actually raised: batch embedding methods (`MicroserviceEmbedder.embed_texts_batch` and `BaseMultimodalMicroserviceEmbedder.embed_texts_batch` / `embed_images_batch`) now raise `EmbeddingClientError` on 4xx responses instead of silently returning `None`. Callers can now distinguish a client-side failure ("we sent bad data") from a parsing error that still returns `None`. `_batch_embed_text_annotations` in `opencontractserver/tasks/embeddings_task.py` catches `EmbeddingClientError` explicitly and records a permanent per-annotation failure without triggering Celery retries — preventing retries from burning on invalid input that will never succeed. The single-text paths (`_embed_text_impl`, `_embed_image_impl`) are intentionally unchanged because their error semantics must not abort remaining annotations in a task. Tests updated in `test_batch_embedding.py` and `test_multimodal_embedder_unit.py`.
  - Moved `import requests` from inside `BaseEmbedder.embed_texts_batch()` to the top of `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/embedder.py`. Local imports are reserved for breaking circular-import cycles; `requests` is already a listed dependency so module-level import is cheaper on repeated calls.
  - Refactored `_create_embedding_for_annotation` in `opencontractserver/tasks/embeddings_task.py` to remove a misleadingly-indented `else` block. The text-only fallthrough now clearly separates the image-drop debug log from the `return _create_text_embedding(...)` statement.
  - Documented in the `calculate_embeddings_for_annotation_batch` docstring that the returned `result` dict counts reflect only the last attempt on Celery retry (not cumulative work across retries). `add_embedding()` is idempotent so there is no correctness risk, but any external monitoring consuming `result` should read Celery task state for cumulative counts.

### Added

- **Document lineage tracking** (IngestionSource + DocumentPath enrichment): New `IngestionSource` model (`opencontractserver/documents/models.py`) registers named integrations/crawlers/pipelines that produce documents. Three new fields on `DocumentPath` — `ingestion_source` (FK), `external_id` (indexed CharField), and `ingestion_metadata` (JSON) — record which source produced each version of a document and with what context. Lineage kwargs flow through `import_document()` (`opencontractserver/documents/versioning.py`), `Corpus.add_document()` (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`), and the `UploadDocument` GraphQL mutation. New GraphQL types (`IngestionSourceType`, `IngestionSourceTypeEnum`), queries (`ingestionSources`, `ingestionSource`), and CRUD mutations (`createIngestionSource`, `updateIngestionSource`, `deleteIngestionSource`) in `config/graphql/`. Migration: `0036_add_ingestion_source_and_lineage_fields`.

- **Document path history tracking** (PR #1195): Document moves via `DocumentFolderService.move_document_to_folder()`, `move_documents_to_folder()`, and `delete_folder()` now create immutable `DocumentPath` history nodes instead of silent in-place updates. Each move produces a new `DocumentPath` record linked to the previous one via `parent`, enabling full audit trail traversal. Path conflicts are resolved by appending numeric suffixes (e.g. `report_1.pdf`). `versioning.py` `determine_action()` now detects folder-only moves (same path string, different `folder_id`). **Atomic guarantees**: Both `delete_folder()` and `move_documents_to_folder()` use `transaction.atomic()` so that if any document fails to relocate, ALL changes are rolled back (no partial-success state). Within-batch path conflict detection prevents two documents with the same filename from colliding during bulk moves. Failed operations are safe to retry. Comprehensive test coverage in `test_document_folder_service.py` for move tracking, path conflicts, bulk moves, delete-folder tracking, atomic rollback, retry-after-failure, and full lifecycle integration.
- **Move-document agent tool** (PR #1196): New `move_document` / `amove_document` tool that moves a document between folders within the same corpus. Delegates to `DocumentFolderService.move_document_to_folder` for permission checks and path updates. Categorized as `ToolCategory.CORPUS` (corpus-level agents only), requires write permission and approval. Pass `target_folder_id` for a specific folder or omit for corpus root. Uses `visible_to_user()` for document and corpus lookups to prevent IDOR enumeration (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools.py`, `opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_registry.py`).

### Changed

- **`move_documents_to_folder()` return value semantics** (PR #1195): The returned `moved_count` now reflects only documents that were actually relocated; documents already in the target folder are skipped and not counted. Previously returned `len(document_ids)` unconditionally.
- **Web search agent tool** (PR #1174): New `aweb_search` tool for agents with pluggable provider backends (Brave Search and Tavily). Introduces `BaseTool` base class (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/base_tool.py`) for tools with database-backed settings and encrypted secrets via `PipelineSettings`. Tools declare a nested `Settings` dataclass with `PipelineSetting` metadata; `is_configured()` gates tool availability at resolution time. `ToolFunctionRegistry` supports `tool_class` entries for database-level enablement gating. New GraphQL mutations `UpdateToolSecretsMutation` and `DeleteToolSecretsMutation` (`config/graphql/pipeline_settings_mutations.py`) allow superusers to manage tool API keys. Includes per-process rate limiting, provider-specific response parsing, and comprehensive test coverage.

### Fixed

- **Quickstart blockers** (PR #1179): Fixed several issues preventing first-time setup from working:
  - Missing `EMBEDDINGS_MICROSERVICE_URL` and `DOCLING_PARSER_SERVICE_URL` env var defaults crash Django on startup (`config/settings/base.py`)
  - Celerybeat race condition on first boot — added Django healthcheck and `service_healthy` dependency for celery services (`local.yml`)
  - Password login broken — JWT middleware was gated behind `USE_AUTH0=True` so `tokenAuth` tokens were never validated (`config/settings/base.py`)
  - Admin user login 500 — `User.save()` re-validated slug on `last_login` updates, and `"admin"` is a reserved slug (`opencontractserver/users/models.py`)
  - Django admin panel 500 on static files — overrode `StaticFilesStorage` in local settings (`config/settings/local.py`)
  - Nginx duplicate `.js` MIME type warning (`frontend/conf/conf.d/default.conf`)
  - Updated README quickstart with missing steps and corrected `docker compose` v2 syntax

### Added

- **CAML Interactive Article System** (PR #1156): Frontend support for corpus articles using CAML (Corpus Article Markup Language). Includes a two-pass parser (tokenizer + block parsers), typed intermediate representation, and composable renderer supporting hero sections, cards, pills, tabs, timelines, CTAs, signup blocks, corpus stats, and pullquotes. Frontend adds `CamlArticleEditor` modal with live preview, `CorpusArticleView` for rendered article display, and `CorpusLandingView` integration for article discovery. Playwright component tests with `docScreenshot` captures for all block types.
- **Extract grid embed in CAML articles** (PR #1177): New `ExtractGridEmbed` component renders extract data tables inline in CAML articles via `[component:extract-grid extractId=...]` marker syntax. Includes `useCamlComponentRenderer` hook and `camlComponents` utility for a generic component marker system, `CAML_COMPONENTS` shared registry (`frontend/src/utils/camlComponentRegistry.ts`), and `ExtractPickerDropdown` toolbar in the editor for inserting extract grids. Query (`GET_EXTRACT_GRID_EMBED`) fetches extract fieldset columns, datacells, and source annotations with deep links to the document viewer.

### Fixed

- **CAML YAML parser nested key bug**: Fixed `parseYamlFrontmatter` in `frontend/src/caml/parser/tokenizer.ts` where `content` used `line.trimEnd()` instead of `line.trimEnd().trimStart()`, causing the key-value regex (`^[a-zA-Z_]...`) to fail for indented nested keys (e.g., `hero.kicker`). Nested frontmatter properties were silently dropped, producing empty objects.

### Changed

- **Replaced hardcoded hex colors with OS_LEGAL_COLORS tokens** in `CamlArticleEditor.tsx` and `CorpusArticleView.tsx`: All hardcoded hex values (`#e2e8f0`, `#fafbfc`, `#f8fafc`, `#64748b`, `#94a3b8`, `#ffffff`, `#fef3c7`, `#92400e`, `#475569`, `#f1f5f9`, `#cbd5e1`) replaced with semantic design tokens from `osLegalStyles.ts`.
- **Extracted `isExternalHref` helper** in `frontend/src/caml/renderer/safeHref.ts`: Deduplicated `href.startsWith("http")` checks across `CamlBlocks.tsx` and `CamlFooter.tsx` into a shared utility function.
- **Removed redundant `articleStats` useMemo** in `CorpusArticleView.tsx`: The memo mirrored its input without transformation; `stats` is now passed directly to `CamlArticle`.

### Fixed

- **Semantic UI removal cleanup** (Closes #1123): Fixed `folderIconAlpha` color mismatch in `ExtractCellFormatter.tsx` StatusDot box-shadows — replaced hardcoded `rgba(245, 158, 11, ...)` with `folderIconAlpha()` to match `getCellBackground()`. Changed Revoke button in `WorkerTokensSection.tsx` from `variant="secondary"` with inline danger color to `variant="danger"` for proper destructive-action styling. Removed conflicting `box-shadow` and `border-radius` from `StyledModalInner` in `EditMessageModal.tsx` to prevent doubled styling with `OsModal` wrapper. Added `role="menu"`, `aria-label`, `aria-haspopup`, keyboard support, and arrow key navigation (roving tabindex) to custom popup in `ExtractCellFormatter.tsx`. Removed redundant Escape key handler from `StatusDot` `onKeyDown` (already handled by global listener). Extracted inline `maxHeight: "70vh"` in `SelectDocumentsModal.tsx` to `MODAL_BODY_MAX_HEIGHT` constant in `constants.ts`.
- **Annotation rendering cleanup** (Closes #1144): Replaced hardcoded `"4px 4px 0 0"` border-radius with `ANNOTATION_BOUNDARY_RADIUS` constant in `SearchResult.tsx` and `ChatSourceResult.tsx`. Removed dead `border` prop from `SelectionInfo` interface and call sites. Used `APPROVED_RGB` constant for approved-state box-shadow in `SelectionBoundary.tsx` (matching `REJECTED_RGB` pattern). Added `TOKEN_EXPANSION_PX` constant and replaced magic `-1`/`+2` token expansion values across `SelectionTokenGroup.tsx`, `Tokens.tsx`, and `ChatSourceTokens.tsx`. Consolidated `[Previous Unreleased]` CHANGELOG section into single `[Unreleased]` block. Removed debug `console.log` statements from `DocumentKnowledgeBase.ct.tsx`, `SearchResult.tsx`, and `SelectionTokenGroup.tsx`. Moved annotation display reactive var initialization into `useEffect` in `DocumentKnowledgeBaseTestWrapper.tsx`.

### Added

- **Index tab in document sidebar**: Added a new "Index" tab (BookOpen icon) to the document viewer sidebar, positioned first before Chat, Feed, and Discussions. The Index tab reuses the `DocumentAnnotationIndex` component to display the document's OC_SECTION-based table of contents directly in the sidebar (`frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/document_kb/RightPanelContent.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/DocumentKnowledgeBase.tsx`).
- **OpenAI Embedder pipeline component** (`opencontractserver/pipeline/embedders/openai_embedder.py`): New `OpenAIEmbedder` class supporting `text-embedding-3-small` (default), `text-embedding-3-large`, and `text-embedding-ada-002` models. Features configurable output dimensions, custom API base URL for Azure/proxy support, and graceful error handling. Dynamic `vector_size` property reflects runtime model/dimension configuration to prevent pgvector column size mismatches.
- **OpenAI embedding constants** (`opencontractserver/constants/embeddings.py`): Centralized model dimension mappings and defaults for the OpenAI embedder.

### Fixed

- **BulkImportModal AlertBox hardcoded colors** (Closes #1145): Replaced `OS_LEGAL_COLORS.warning*` / `OS_LEGAL_COLORS.info*` constants with CSS custom properties (`var(--oc-warning-*)`, `var(--oc-info-*)`). Added the six new tokens to `index.css :root` so they participate in theme switching (`frontend/src/index.css`, `frontend/src/components/widgets/modals/UploadModalStyles.ts`).
- **CloudUpload icon inline magic numbers** (Closes #1145): Replaced `style={{ width: 16, height: 16, marginRight: 8 }}` on the Start Import button icon with a new `ButtonIcon` styled component that uses `var(--oc-font-size-md)` and `var(--oc-spacing-xs)` tokens (`frontend/src/components/widgets/modals/BulkImportModal.tsx`, `UploadModalStyles.ts`).
- **Remaining pixel values in styled components** (Closes #1145): Replaced `HeaderIcon` 28px/15px with `calc()` expressions using spacing/font tokens, `DropZone` 200px/160px min-heights with `calc(var(--oc-spacing-xl) * N)`, and `AlertBox` SVG 2px margin-top with `calc(var(--oc-spacing-xs) / 4)` with a documenting comment (`UploadModalStyles.ts`).
- **Missing InMemoryCache in BulkImportTestWrapper** (Closes #1145): Added `InMemoryCache` with relevant type policies and a `mocks` prop to match the `DocumentKnowledgeBaseTestWrapper` pattern (`frontend/tests/wrappers/BulkImportTestWrapper.tsx`).

### Added

- **Sidecar JSON schema validation before annotation import** (Closes #1127): Added `_validate_sidecar_schema()` in `opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks.py` that validates container types (`labelled_text`, `doc_labels`, `relationships` must be lists) and required keys per entry (`annotationLabel`/`rawText`/`annotation_json` for annotations; `relationshipLabel`/`source_annotation_ids`/`target_annotation_ids` for relationships) before any database work. Invalid sidecars now increment `annotation_sidecars_errored` and log clear error messages instead of crashing or silently skipping data. Comprehensive unit and integration tests added in `opencontractserver/tests/test_sidecar_import.py`.
- **Progress step test coverage for BulkImportModal** (Closes #1145): New test exercises the progress UI (spinner, progress bar, "Importing Documents..." heading) by mocking `IMPORT_ZIP_TO_CORPUS` with a long delay, verifying the loading state is rendered and footer buttons are hidden during import (`frontend/tests/bulk-import-modal.ct.tsx`).

### Added

- **Schema validation for `labels.json` before processing annotation labels** (Closes #1128): Added `validate_labels_data()` in `opencontractserver/utils/importing.py` that validates the structure of `labels.json` before `prepare_import_labels()` is called. Checks that `text_labels`/`doc_labels` are dicts (not lists), each label entry is a dict with a required non-empty `text` field, and optional fields (`label_type`, `color`, `icon`, `description`) have correct types. Validation errors are logged and appended to `results["errors"]` with `labels_loaded` set to `False`. Added unit tests (`TestValidateLabelsData`) and integration tests (`TestMalformedLabelsImport`) in `opencontractserver/tests/test_sidecar_import.py`.

### Changed

- **Batch embedding API calls for annotation embeddings** (PR #1148): Refactored `calculate_embeddings_for_annotation_batch` Celery task to use `embed_texts_batch()` for text-only annotations instead of embedding one-at-a-time, reducing HTTP requests from one-per-annotation to one-per-sub-batch. Key changes:
  - New `embed_texts_batch()` extension point on `BaseEmbedder` (`opencontractserver/pipeline/base/embedder.py`): default sequential fallback that re-raises transient HTTP exceptions; subclasses override for true batch API endpoints.
  - `MicroserviceEmbedder.embed_texts_batch()` calls `/embeddings/batch` with per-item NaN detection, vector-count mismatch validation, and 5xx → `EmbeddingServerError` for Celery retry (`opencontractserver/pipeline/embedders/sent_transformer_microservice.py`).
  - Moved `EmbeddingClientError` / `EmbeddingServerError` to `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/exceptions.py` (breaking import path change for external embedders that imported from `multimodal_microservice`).
  - Django system check `documents.E001` validates `EMBEDDING_API_BATCH_SIZE <= MICROSERVICE_EMBEDDER_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` at startup (`opencontractserver/documents/checks.py`).
  - New constants in `opencontractserver/constants/document_processing.py`: `EMBEDDING_API_BATCH_SIZE` (50), `MICROSERVICE_EMBEDDER_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (100), `EMBEDDER_SINGLE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (30), `EMBEDDER_BATCH_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (60).
  - Extracted `_get_service_config()` helper in `MicroserviceEmbedder` to eliminate config duplication.
  - Comprehensive test suite (938 lines) covering sequential fallback, partial failures, vector count mismatch, per-item NaN handling, sub-batching, transient error propagation through the full Celery task, and dual-strategy fallback (`opencontractserver/tests/test_batch_embedding.py`).
- **Deferred structural annotation loading for PDF performance**: Structural annotations (headers, sections, paragraphs — often 4,000-6,000 for large documents) are no longer fetched in the initial GraphQL queries. They are loaded lazily via `GET_DOCUMENT_STRUCTURAL_ANNOTATIONS` only when the user toggles structural visibility on. Also removed redundant structural annotation re-fetching during analysis/extract switching (structural annotations are analysis-independent). For a 200-page document, this eliminates ~5-20MB of JSON from the initial payload (`frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`, `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/DocumentKnowledgeBase.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/context/AnnotationAtoms.tsx`).
- **OC\_\* annotations filtered from Feed**: Platform-generated annotations with labels prefixed `OC_` (e.g., `OC_SECTION`) are now always hidden from the UnifiedContentFeed, preventing structural index entries from cluttering the annotation feed (`frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/unified_feed/UnifiedContentFeed.tsx`).
- **Improved sidebar tab spacing**: Reduced tab dimensions (76px/88px height, 36px/44px width), gap (4px), padding, icon size, and font size to prevent overlap when additional tabs are present (`frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/styled/SidebarTabs.tsx`).
- **Softened PDF annotation bounding boxes to diffuse highlighter-pen aesthetic**: Replaced hard-edged borders on annotation boundaries, tokens, and label pills with multi-layer box-shadow glows. Boundaries use a three-layer shadow (outer, mid, inset) that feathers into the page. Tokens use a single-layer soft blur. Approved/rejected states pulse with matching diffuse glows instead of solid borders. Extracted shared `computeAnnotationBoxShadow` utility (`frontend/src/utils/colorUtils.ts`) to eliminate duplicated shadow logic between `SelectionBoundary` and `ResultBoundary`. Added named constants for all shadow radii, opacity levels, border-radius tiers, and status colors (`frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts`). Removed dead code: `getBorderWidthFromBounds`, unused `$border` prop, unused `$isSelected` prop. Fixed `pulseMaroon` animation color mismatch (was `rgba(180, 40, 40)`, now matches static rejected state).
- **Reorganized upload documentation into dedicated `docs/upload_methods/` section**: Consolidated scattered upload-related docs into 8 user-facing reference pages covering single upload, bulk ZIP import, corpus export/import, annotated document import, worker uploads, supported formats, and annotation side effects. Simplified `docs/walkthrough/step-1-add-documents.md` and `docs/walkthrough/advanced/export-import-corpuses.md` to reference the new guides. Trimmed `docs/architecture/bulk-import.md` to focus on internal implementation. Removed obsolete `docs/features/zip_import_with_folders_design.md` design doc (feature is fully implemented).

### Fixed

- **`skip_pipeline=True` silently ignored `meta.csv` metadata** (Closes #1131): Documents created via the `skip_pipeline` path in `import_zip_with_folder_structure` now have their title, description, custom_meta, and is_public fields applied from `meta.csv` and task-level parameters, matching the behavior of the normal pipeline path (`opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks.py`).
- **Incomplete assertion in `test_malformed_labels_json_records_error`** (Closes #1131): The test now also asserts that `annotation_sidecars_errored` is incremented when labels.json is malformed and a sidecar contains annotations (`opencontractserver/tests/test_sidecar_import.py`).

### Added

- **Test for `skip_pipeline=True` with no `labels.json`** (Closes #1131): New test `test_skip_pipeline_without_labels_json` verifies that pipeline-skipped documents are created successfully even when no labels file is present, and that annotation import errors are recorded properly (`opencontractserver/tests/test_sidecar_import.py`).
- **Test for `skip_pipeline=True` with `meta.csv` metadata** (Closes #1131): New test `test_skip_pipeline_applies_metadata_from_csv` verifies that pipeline-skipped documents correctly receive title and description overrides from `meta.csv`.
- **Per-sidecar JSON size limit** (Closes #1131): Added `ZIP_MAX_SIDECAR_SIZE_BYTES` constant (10 MB default) in `opencontractserver/constants/zip_import.py`. Sidecars exceeding this limit are skipped with an error, preventing oversized JSON from consuming excessive memory during import (`opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks.py`).

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **`COMMUNITY_STATS_CACHE_TTL` env var for community stats caching** (`config/graphql/social_queries.py`, `opencontractserver/constants/community_stats.py`): The `communityStats` GraphQL resolver now caches results using Django's cache framework with a configurable TTL (default 1 hour). This avoids re-running 7+ COUNT queries on every landing page load. Cache is keyed by user type (anonymous vs authenticated) and optional corpus scope. Also includes an N+1 fix using `in_bulk()` for badge distribution and a subquery optimization in `resolve_corpus_categories`.

### Changed

- **Refactored FullScreenModal to use native `size="fullscreen"` variant** (Closes #1073): Replaced the `createGlobalStyle` workaround in `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/LayoutComponents.tsx` with the native `size="fullscreen"` prop from `@os-legal/ui`, which handles viewport positioning, sizing, border-radius removal, and overlay padding natively. Only minimal body styling overrides (background color, padding, and overflow) remain.
- **Added `overlayClassName` to CorpusModal** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusModal.tsx`): Uses the new `overlayClassName` prop to properly apply the `.corpus-modal-overlay` styles to the portal-rendered overlay element, fixing mobile overlay styles that were previously unreachable.
- **Complete removal of Semantic UI React dependency**: Migrated all 19 remaining files that imported from `semantic-ui-react` to use `@os-legal/ui` equivalents and native HTML elements. Component mappings: `Label` → `Chip`, `Modal/ModalHeader/ModalContent/ModalActions` → `Modal/ModalHeader/ModalBody/ModalFooter`, `Button` → `Button`, `Confirm` → custom confirm dialog via `Modal`, `Loader/Dimmer` → `Spinner`, `Dropdown` → `Dropdown`, `Icon` → lucide-react icons, `Segment/Card/Form` → styled HTML elements. Removed `semantic-ui-css` and `semantic-ui-react` from `package.json`, deleted the semantic-ui CSS import from `App.tsx` and `playwright/index.tsx`, and removed the orphaned `semantic.css` asset file. Also replaced the `SemanticICONS` type with `string` in `graphql/mutations.ts`.

### Fixed

- **Undefined ordering in async note retrieval** (Closes #1107): Added missing `.order_by("created")` to `aget_notes_for_document_corpus` in `opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools.py`, matching the sync counterpart `get_notes_for_document_corpus` which already had deterministic ordering.
- **Tool name breaking change from async migration** (Closes #1107): `create_document_tools()` in `opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_factory.py` derived tool names from `func.__name__`, causing names to silently change from e.g. `load_document_md_summary` to `aload_document_md_summary` when the registry switched to async functions. Added explicit `name=` parameters to all `CoreTool.from_function()` calls to preserve the original tool names.
- **Test username typo**: Fixed "toklenuser" → "tokenuser" in `opencontractserver/tests/test_agent_search_tools.py`.
- **Misleading CleanViewContainer comment** (`frontend/src/views/Corpuses.tsx`): Corrected the styled-component comment that claimed height constraints were "intentionally removed" when `height: 100%`, `min-height: 0`, and `overflow: hidden` were still present. The comment now accurately documents the height model and explains that only `max-height: 100dvh` was removed. Closes #1044 (items 1 & 2).

### Added

- **Annotation sidecar import for bulk zip upload** (`opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks.py`, `opencontractserver/utils/zip_security.py`): The `ImportZipToCorpus` mutation now supports importing pre-calculated annotations alongside source documents. When a document file (e.g. `contracts/master.pdf`) has a co-located `.json` sidecar (e.g. `contracts/master.json`) conforming to `OpenContractDocExport`, annotations and intra-document relationships are imported from the sidecar instead of running the parser pipeline. A root-level `labels.json` file provides label definitions. Documents without sidecars continue through the normal pipeline. This enables mixed-mode imports where some documents have pre-computed annotations and others are parsed fresh.
- **Test coverage for Focus/Power mode toggle** (`frontend/tests/CorpusHome.ct.tsx`, `frontend/tests/CorpusHomeTestWrapper.tsx`): Added four Playwright component tests exercising the `onModeToggle` and `isPowerUserMode` props: toggle hidden when callback absent, toggle visible in focus mode, toggle reflects power-user state, and click fires callback. Updated `CorpusHomeTestWrapper` to forward mode-toggle props. Closes #1044 (item 5).
- **Tighten MCP telemetry input validation and test coverage** (Closes #1106):
  - Bound User-Agent storage to 512 characters (`MAX_USER_AGENT_LENGTH`) in both `set_request_context()` and `get_user_agent_from_scope()` to prevent attacker-controlled multi-megabyte values from reaching telemetry backends (`opencontractserver/mcp/telemetry.py`)
  - Empty-string slugs no longer reach telemetry — changed `if slug is not None` to falsy checks (`if slug`) consistently across all sync and async recording functions
  - Documented the duplicate-header-dropping assumption when converting ASGI header lists to dicts in `get_user_agent_from_scope()` and `get_claimed_client_ip_from_scope()`
  - Added async telemetry tests for `arecord_mcp_tool_call`, `arecord_mcp_resource_read`, and `arecord_mcp_request` (`opencontractserver/tests/test_mcp_extended.py`)
  - Added tests for User-Agent truncation and empty-string slug filtering

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-15

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed `tokensJsons` and `boundingBox` from GraphQL API**: The `tokensJsons` and `boundingBox` fields have been removed from GraphQL annotation queries and mutations (PR #1100). External API consumers and integrations must update to use the `json` field instead. The `json` field contains either v1 (legacy page-keyed format) or v2 (compact format) annotation data. Use `iter_page_annotations()` (Python) or `iterPageAnnotations()` (TypeScript) for format-agnostic access.

### Added

- **Dynamic MIME type support from pipeline components** (Closes #1059): Supported file types are now derived dynamically from registered pipeline components instead of being hardcoded. Changes include:
  - New `get_supported_mime_types()` and `get_allowed_mime_types()` functions in `opencontractserver/pipeline/registry.py` that compute supported file types by intersecting component coverage across parser, embedder, and thumbnailer stages
  - New `supportedMimeTypes` GraphQL query (`config/graphql/pipeline_queries.py`) returning per-file-type support level with stage coverage details
  - New `SupportedMimeTypeType` and `StageCoverageType` GraphQL types (`config/graphql/pipeline_types.py`)
  - Centralized MIME ↔ file type mappings (`MIME_TO_FILE_TYPE`, `FILE_TYPE_TO_MIME`, `FILE_TYPE_LABELS`, `LEGACY_MIME_ALIASES`) in `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/file_types.py`, replacing scattered inline dicts
  - Upload validation in `document_mutations.py`, `folder_service.py`, and `import_tasks.py` now uses the dynamic registry instead of `settings.ALLOWED_DOCUMENT_MIMETYPES`
  - Frontend `FiletypeDefaults` component fetches supported MIME types via GraphQL query instead of using hardcoded `SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES` constant
  - Warning icon displayed for partially-supported file types (e.g., DOCX which lacks a thumbnailer)
  - `FileTypeEnum` gains `.mimetype` and `.label` properties and supports legacy MIME aliases in `from_mimetype()`
- **Compact PAWLs v2 format for ~67% storage reduction** (PR #1112): New v2 compact format for PAWLs files (per-page token bounding boxes) that reduces storage from ~500+ KB to ~180 KB for a typical 9-page PDF. Changes include:
  - Core encode/decode in `opencontractserver/utils/compact_pawls.py` (Python) and `frontend/src/utils/compactPawls.ts` (TypeScript)
  - Array-based tokens `[x, y, w, h, "text"]` instead of verbose dicts, shortened page keys, implicit page index, coordinate precision normalization
  - Write paths (parser, import, worker upload) auto-compact on save; read paths transparently expand v2 → v1
  - Safety limit: `COMPACT_PAWLS_MAX_TOKENS_PER_PAGE` (100,000) in `opencontractserver/constants/pawls.py` — graceful fallback to v1 when exceeded
  - Comprehensive Python (5 test classes) and TypeScript (8 tests) unit tests including roundtrip and image token coverage

- **Compact annotation JSON v2 format for ~75% storage reduction** (PR #1100): New compact v2 format for annotation JSON payloads that range-encodes consecutive token indices, compacts bounds to arrays, and drops redundant `pageIndex` and `rawText` from per-page data. Changes include:
  - Core encode/decode in `opencontractserver/annotations/compact_json.py` (Python) and `frontend/src/utils/compactAnnotationJson.ts` (TypeScript)
  - Safety limits: `COMPACT_JSON_MAX_RANGE_SPAN` (10,000) and `COMPACT_JSON_MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS` (50,000) in `opencontractserver/constants/annotations.py`
  - `Annotation.save()` auto-compacts v1 → v2 on write (lazy migration) with exception guard for malformed legacy data
  - Migration `0066` removes redundant `tokens_jsons` and `bounding_box` columns (includes `RunPython` backfill step to preserve any legacy data before column removal — **irreversible migration**)
  - 60+ Python and 48+ TypeScript unit tests for the codec
  - All GraphQL queries/mutations updated to use `json` field instead of `tokensJsons` and `boundingBox`
  - Format-agnostic accessor layer: `iter_page_annotations()`, `offset_annotation_json()`, `has_any_tokens()` (Python) and `iterPageAnnotations()`, `hasAnyTokens()` (TypeScript) — all production code migrated off `expand_annotation_json()`
  - `ServerTokenAnnotation` constructor now accepts both v1 and v2 formats, normalizing internally

### Added

- **Document index feature (within-document TOC)**: Hierarchical, navigable section index for long documents with markdown descriptions. Changes include:
  - New `long_description` (TextField, nullable) on the Annotation model for markdown section summaries (`opencontractserver/annotations/models.py`)
  - Database migration `0066_annotation_long_description`
  - `OC_SECTION` label constant (`opencontractserver/constants/annotations.py`) — `OC_` namespace for platform-generated labels
  - New `create_document_index` agent tool for building hierarchical indexes from exact string matches (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools.py`)
  - Tool registered in tool registry with approval gate (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_registry.py`)
  - `long_description` exposed in GraphQL AnnotationType (auto-resolved), UpdateAnnotation mutation, and AnnotationSerializer
  - Export/import extended: `long_description` in `OpenContractsAnnotationPythonType`, import reads it, export includes it
  - New `DocumentAnnotationIndex` frontend component with tree rendering, expandable markdown descriptions, page badges, and filter support (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/DocumentAnnotationIndex.tsx`)
  - `DocumentTableOfContents` now renders annotation indexes under each document node; single-doc corpora skip the document header and show sections directly
  - New `GET_DOCUMENT_ANNOTATION_INDEX` GraphQL query and TypeScript types (`frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`)
  - Frontend constants: `DOCUMENT_ANNOTATION_INDEX_LIMIT`, `OC_SECTION_LABEL` (`frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts`)
- **First-class DOCX document support via Docxodus pipeline**: Added a complete parallel ingestion pipeline and rendering tree for DOCX files, bringing Word document support alongside existing PDF and TXT pipelines. Changes include:
  - **Backend: Docxodus microservice** (`docxodus-service/`): .NET 8 minimal API wrapping `OpenContractExporter.Export()` to produce OpenContractDocExport-compatible JSON with structural annotations and character offsets from DOCX files. Multi-stage Docker build exposed on port 8080.
  - **Backend: DocxodusServiceParser** (`opencontractserver/pipeline/parsers/docxodus_parser.py`): REST parser that sends base64-encoded DOCX to the microservice, normalizes camelCase→snake_case response fields, and handles transient/permanent error classification.
  - **Backend: DocxThumbnailGenerator** (`opencontractserver/pipeline/thumbnailers/docx_thumbnailer.py`): Two-tier thumbnail approach — extracts embedded thumbnails from DOCX ZIP archives (`docProps/thumbnail.jpeg`), falling back to text-based thumbnails via XML parsing of `word/document.xml`.
  - **Frontend: DocxAnnotator** (`frontend/src/components/annotator/renderers/docx/DocxAnnotator.tsx`): WASM-powered DOCX renderer using `docxodus` npm package's `convertDocxToHtmlWithExternalAnnotations()` for annotation projection onto native DOCX HTML output. Supports text selection for new annotation creation via `findTextOccurrences()`.
  - **Frontend: DocxAnnotatorWrapper** (`frontend/src/components/annotator/components/wrappers/DocxAnnotatorWrapper.tsx`): State management wrapper mirroring TxtAnnotatorWrapper pattern — manages annotation CRUD, chat sources, text search, and ref registration.
  - **Frontend: DocumentKnowledgeBase integration**: DOCX loading flow (fetches raw bytes + extracted text) and renderer dispatch added to both query handlers.
  - **Frontend utilities**: `isDocxFileType()` in `frontend/src/utils/files.ts`, `DOCX_MIME_TYPE` constant, `docxBytesAtom` / `useDocxBytes()` hook in DocumentAtom, `getDocxBytes()` in cachedRest.
  - **Docker Compose**: `docxodus-parser` service added to `local.yml`, `production.yml`, and `test.yml` with dependency wiring.
  - **Dependencies**: `docxodus@5.5.0` and `dompurify@3.3.3` added to frontend.
  - **Backend tests**: `test_doc_parser_docxodus.py` with parser unit tests (success, timeout, connection error, normalization) and thumbnailer tests (text preview, embedded thumbnail, invalid DOCX handling).
  - **Frontend tests**: `DocxAnnotator.ct.tsx` component test with `docScreenshot` captures.
- **Richer social media link previews for corpus and document links**: Improved the Cloudflare OG worker to generate better social tags. Changes include:
  - Corpus descriptions are now included in OG/Twitter description tags, combined with document count (e.g. "Corpus description — 15 documents")
  - Document-in-corpus links now surface the parent corpus description when the document lacks its own description
  - Added Twitter structured data tags (`twitter:label1`/`twitter:data1`, `twitter:label2`/`twitter:data2`) showing author, document count, corpus name, etc.
  - New `corpus_description` field on `OGDocumentMetadataType` GraphQL type (`config/graphql/og_metadata_types.py`)
  - Backend resolver returns corpus description for document-in-corpus queries (`config/graphql/og_metadata_queries.py`)
  - Fixed pre-existing TypeScript type errors in worker test suite and metadata extraction
- **Creative Commons license support for corpuses**: Corpuses can now have a license applied, choosing from standard Creative Commons licenses (CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC-ND, CC0) or a custom license with a URL. Changes include:
  - New `license` (CharField with SPDX identifiers) and `license_link` (URLField) fields on the Corpus model (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`)
  - License constants in `opencontractserver/constants/licenses.py` and `frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts`
  - Database migration `0047_corpus_license_fields` (single migration with URL validation)
  - GraphQL create/update mutations accept `license` and `licenseLink` arguments
  - New `LicenseSelector` frontend component (`frontend/src/components/widgets/CRUD/LicenseSelector.tsx`)
  - CorpusModal updated with License section for create/edit flows
  - CorpusInfoSection displays the selected license in corpus settings

### Fixed

- **Token bounding box drift in PDF viewer**: Fixed progressive misalignment between token bounding boxes (blue outlines) and rendered PDF text. PAWLs token coordinates are extracted by the parser in its own coordinate system, which can differ from PDF.js's viewport coordinate system. The frontend now normalizes token coordinates by comparing PAWLs page dimensions (`page.width`/`page.height`) against the PDF.js viewport dimensions at scale 1, rescaling tokens when they differ. Added `normalizeTokensToPdfViewport()` utility in `frontend/src/utils/transform.tsx` and applied it in both PDF loading paths in `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/DocumentKnowledgeBase.tsx`.
- **Auth0 SDK blocked by CSP on admin login page** (Closes #1077): The admin login template loads the Auth0 SPA SDK from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, but the Content-Security-Policy `script-src` directive did not include this origin, causing browsers to block the script. Added `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` to `script-src` when Auth0 is enabled. (`config/settings/base.py`)
- **PostgreSQL HNSW config warning on startup** (Closes #1074): Fixed `invalid configuration parameter name 'hnsw.iterative_scan'` warning caused by database-level `ALTER DATABASE SET` GUC defaults persisting in `pg_db_role_setting`. The docker-entrypoint-initdb.d phase runs in a temporary postgres without the user's command-line args, so `hnsw.*` GUCs aren't registered when the database-level defaults are later applied on connections. Consolidated shared postgres settings (`shared_preload_libraries`, HNSW, I/O tuning) into `compose/postgres/shared.conf` with a custom entrypoint wrapper that injects them as `-c` flags. Per-environment memory settings remain in compose files. Removed `ALTER DATABASE SET` from `init.sql`. Added migration 0066 to RESET stale database-level defaults. **Upgrade note:** Existing users must rebuild the postgres image (`docker compose build postgres`) to pick up the new entrypoint wrapper and shared config file. (`compose/postgres/shared.conf`, `compose/postgres/docker-entrypoint-wrapper.sh`, `compose/production/postgres/Dockerfile`, `compose/production/postgres/init.sql`, `opencontractserver/annotations/migrations/0066_reset_database_level_hnsw_settings.py`)
- **Single-select Dropdown missing onBlur in MetadataCellEditor** (PR #1076): Two single-select `Dropdown` instances (STRING with choices, CHOICE type) silently dropped the `onBlur` callback during the SUI→@os-legal/ui migration, causing metadata grid cells to never exit edit mode after selection. Initially worked around with `onClose={onBlur}` in v0.1.13; upgraded to proper `onBlur={onBlur}` prop in v0.1.14. (`frontend/src/components/metadata/editors/MetadataCellEditor.tsx`)
- **Dropdown test selectors outdated after @os-legal/ui upgrade**: Updated CSS selectors in `DocumentMetadataGrid.ct.tsx` from `.oc-select-trigger`/`.oc-select-search` to `.oc-dropdown__trigger`/`.oc-dropdown__search-input` to match the v0.1.13 Dropdown component's class names. Changed Enter-key selection to direct `.oc-dropdown__option` click. (`frontend/tests/DocumentMetadataGrid.ct.tsx`)

### Changed

- **Enforced async-only tool registry for LLM agent tools**: Audited and converted the entire tool registry to reject sync functions. Previously `ToolRegistryEntry` carried both `sync_func` and `async_func` fields, `FUNCTION_MAP` registered both versions, and `PydanticAIToolWrapper` had a sync wrapper path that called sync functions without a thread pool (risking `SynchronousOnlyOperation`). Changes include:
  - Removed `sync_func` field from `ToolRegistryEntry` — only `async_func` remains (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_registry.py`)
  - Simplified `FUNCTION_MAP` from 3-tuples `(sync, async, aliases)` to 2-tuples `(async, aliases)`, removing all sync imports from `_populate()`
  - Replaced sync wrapper path in `PydanticAIToolWrapper` with a `TypeError` guard that rejects sync functions at construction time (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/pydantic_ai_tools.py`)
  - Created async versions of `get_note_content_token_length` and `get_partial_note_content` (`aget_note_content_token_length`, `aget_partial_note_content`) which previously only had sync versions that used `Note.objects.get()` (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools.py`)
  - Updated `create_document_tools()` to use only async functions (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_factory.py`)
  - Updated `__init__.py` exports to async-only (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/__init__.py`)
  - Updated affected tests to use async functions and added new tests for sync rejection

- **SUI Tab migration to @os-legal/ui FilterTabs** (Closes #1022 — tab portion): Removed unused `Tab` and `Menu` imports from `semantic-ui-react` in `frontend/src/views/Corpuses.tsx`. Replaced custom styled `Tab`/`TabContainer` components and custom `SearchInput` in `frontend/src/views/GlobalDiscussions.tsx` with `FilterTabs` and `SearchBox` from `@os-legal/ui`, consistent with the rest of the codebase.

- **Migrated frontend from Semantic UI React to @os-legal/ui design system**: Replaced Modal, Button, Input, and other UI components across the entire frontend with `@os-legal/ui` equivalents. Updated icon system from Semantic UI icons to lucide-react. Introduced `OS_LEGAL_COLORS`, `OS_LEGAL_TYPOGRAPHY`, and `OS_LEGAL_SPACING` design tokens for consistent styling. Upgraded `@os-legal/ui` from 0.1.8 to 0.1.14.
- **Replaced hardcoded hex colors with design system tokens**: Consolidated ~50 color tokens and replaced hardcoded hex color literals across 150+ files with `OS_LEGAL_COLORS` constants from `osLegalStyles.ts`.
- **Extracted shared corpus object collection logic** into `opencontractserver/utils/corpus_collector.py`: New `collect_corpus_objects()` utility and `CorpusObjectCollection` dataclass consolidate duplicated corpus forking/export collection logic (Issue #816)

### Added

- **Dynamic discovery endpoints for crawlers and AI agents**: Replaced static `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, and `llms-full.txt` files with Django views that dynamically generate content with live data from the database. New endpoints:
  - `robots.txt`: Includes explicit `Allow` directives for AI crawler user-agents (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, anthropic-ai, Google-Extended, PerplexityBot, Bytespider, cohere-ai) and a proper `Sitemap:` reference to `sitemap.xml`
  - `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`: Now auto-populate an "Available Collections" section listing all public corpuses with titles, slugs, document counts, and descriptions. Hostnames are resolved from the request instead of using placeholder text. Links use proper inline Markdown format per the llmstxt.org spec
  - `sitemap.xml`: New XML sitemap listing homepage, public corpuses, their documents (via DocumentPath), and discovery endpoints
  - `.well-known/mcp.json`: New MCP server discovery endpoint listing the global MCP server and per-corpus scoped servers
    (`opencontractserver/discovery/views.py`, `opencontractserver/discovery/urls.py`, `config/urls.py`)
- **Traefik routing for discovery endpoints**: Updated production and CI Traefik configs to route `/robots.txt`, `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, and `/.well-known/*` to Django instead of the frontend nginx container (`compose/production/traefik/traefik.yml`, `compose/production/traefik/traefik-ci.yml`)
- **MCP discovery link in HTML head**: Added `<link rel="alternate" type="application/json" href="/.well-known/mcp.json">` to `frontend/index.html` for agent discovery
- **Comprehensive test suite** for all five discovery endpoints covering content types, spec conformance, public/private corpus filtering, hostname resolution, and edge cases (`opencontractserver/discovery/tests/test_discovery_views.py`)

### Removed

- **Unused `django-crispy-forms` and `crispy-bootstrap5` dependencies**: These were cookiecutter-django boilerplate never used by the project (React frontend uses its own form components). Removed packages from `requirements/base.txt`, `INSTALLED_APPS`, and `CRISPY_*` settings from `config/settings/base.py`.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate enabled-field logic**: `ComponentLibrary` now reads the backend-computed `component.enabled` field instead of recalculating enablement from the `enabledComponents` list, eliminating divergent sources of truth (issue #1036 item 1). (`frontend/src/components/admin/system_settings/ComponentLibrary.tsx`)
- **Silent toggle failure**: Toggle clicks while components are loading now show a toast warning instead of silently failing (issue #1036 item 2). (`frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx`)
- **MIME-type fallback flaw**: `FiletypeDefaults` now falls back to the full MIME string when the short-label lookup misses, preventing all availability checks from failing for unmapped types (issue #1036 item 3). (`frontend/src/components/admin/system_settings/FiletypeDefaults.tsx`)
- **Unused postProcessors fetch**: Removed `postProcessors` from the `GET_PIPELINE_COMPONENTS` GraphQL query since no frontend component consumes it (issue #1036 item 4). (`frontend/src/components/admin/system_settings/graphql.ts`)
- **Potential duplicate class names**: Toggle handler now deduplicates component paths when transitioning from all-enabled to an explicit list (issue #1036 item 5). (`frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx`)
- **Replicated empty-list-as-all-enabled semantics**: Extracted `isComponentEnabled` and `isComponentAvailable` into a shared `utils.ts` module, consolidating the repeated logic into one place (issue #1036 item 6). (`frontend/src/components/admin/system_settings/utils.ts`)
- **Implicit test dependency**: Added explicit class-level constants for test component paths and expanded `test_pipeline_components_query_non_superuser_filters_configured` to verify all component stages, not just parsers (issue #1036 item 8). (`opencontractserver/tests/test_pipeline_component_queries.py`)
- **Corpus preferred_embedder not set when default is empty** (pre-existing): `Corpus.save()` used `if not self.preferred_embedder and default_embedder` which skipped assignment when `get_default_embedder_path()` returned `""`. Changed to `if self.preferred_embedder is None` so the field is always populated consistently. (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:426`)
- **Stale postProcessors in PipelineComponentsType**: Removed unused `postProcessors` field from the `PipelineComponentsType` TypeScript type to match the system settings GQL query. (`frontend/src/types/graphql-api.ts`)

### Added

#### Unified Rate Limiting for WebSocket and MCP (Closes #730, #745)

- Replaced `django-ratelimit` with a custom protocol-agnostic rate limiting engine (`config/ratelimit/`) supporting GraphQL, WebSocket, MCP, and Django views through a single shared infrastructure
- **Engine** (`config/ratelimit/engine.py`): Fixed-window counter algorithm using Django cache (Redis in production), with sync `is_rate_limited()` and async `ais_rate_limited()` APIs
- **Identity resolution** (`config/ratelimit/keys.py`): Unified IP extraction from both `HttpRequest` (GraphQL/views) and ASGI scope (WebSocket/MCP), plus key building with `user_or_ip`, `ip`, and `user` strategies
- **Rate categories** (`config/ratelimit/rates.py`): `RateLimits` singleton with 17 categories including new `WS_CONNECT` (10/m), `WS_HEARTBEAT` (120/m), and `MCP_GLOBAL` (100/m)
- **WebSocket rate limiting**: All 3 consumers (`UnifiedAgentConversationConsumer`, `NotificationConsumer`, `ThreadUpdatesConsumer`) now enforce connection-rate and per-message limits. Rate-limited messages receive a JSON `RATE_LIMITED` error; the connection stays open
- **MCP rate limiting**: Two-layer check — global cap (`MCP_GLOBAL`) plus per-tool limits mapped to existing categories (e.g., `search_corpus` → `READ_HEAVY`). ASGI scope threaded into tool handlers via `ContextVar`
- **Django view adapter** (`view_ratelimit`): Drop-in replacement for `django_ratelimit.decorators.ratelimit`, used in admin login views
- **Backward-compatible re-exports**: `config/graphql/ratelimits.py` remains a valid import path for all existing GraphQL files
- Comprehensive test suite (`opencontractserver/tests/test_unified_rate_limiting.py`) covering engine, keys, rates, and all protocol adapters

- Backend mutation test for the all-enabled-to-explicit toggle transition, verifying the mutation succeeds and the query reflects the change (issue #1036 item 7). (`opencontractserver/tests/test_pipeline_settings.py`)

### Changed

- **`add_annotations_from_exact_strings` API simplified to single-document** (breaking): Replaced per-item `(label, text, doc_id, corpus_id)` tuples with a flat `document_id`/`corpus_id` pair plus `AnnotationItem` TypedDict items containing only `label_text` and `exact_string`. Callers that previously annotated multiple documents in one call must now make separate calls per document. (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/core_tools.py`)

### Added

#### Action Library (Corpus Action Templates)

- **CorpusActionTemplate model** for reusable, agent-based action definitions that users can browse and add to individual corpuses (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`)
- **5 default action templates** seeded via data migration: Document Description Updater, Corpus Description Updater, Document Summary Generator, Key Terms Annotator, Document Notes Generator — each with a dedicated `AgentConfiguration` and curated tool set (`opencontractserver/agents/migrations/0010_create_default_action_templates.py`)
- **Action Library UI**: "Add from Library" picker in Corpus Settings lets users browse available templates and add them to a corpus on demand. New corpora start empty — no auto-cloning (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/settings/CorpusActionsSection.tsx`)
- **`addTemplateToCorpus` mutation**: Clones a template into a `CorpusAction` for a given corpus with duplicate prevention (`config/graphql/corpus_mutations.py`)
- **`source_template` FK on CorpusAction**: Links cloned actions back to their source template for provenance tracking (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`)
- **GraphQL query `corpusActionTemplates`**: Read-only query exposing available templates with optional `isActive` filter (`config/graphql/action_queries.py`)
- **`sourceTemplate` field on CorpusActionType**: Exposes template provenance in the existing corpus actions GraphQL type (`config/graphql/agent_types.py`)
- **`seed_action_templates` management command**: Idempotent command for seeding default templates on fresh databases (`opencontractserver/corpuses/management/commands/seed_action_templates.py`)

#### Optimize Vector Search and Index Scalability for Million-Scale Corpora

- **HNSW indexes on all Embedding vector columns** (384–4096 dimensions): Approximate nearest neighbor search reduces vector queries from O(n) sequential scan to O(log n). Created via `AddIndexConcurrently` to avoid table locks during index creation (`opencontractserver/annotations/models.py`, `opencontractserver/annotations/migrations/0063_add_hnsw_indexes_and_search_vector.py`)
- **Eliminated Python-side materialization** in `VectorSearchViaEmbeddingMixin.search_by_embedding()`: Previously materialized ALL matching rows into Python, sorted, and sliced. Now uses PostgreSQL `ORDER BY + LIMIT` so only top-k rows cross the wire. The unique constraint from migration 0059 guarantees no JOIN duplicates, removing the need for `DISTINCT ON` (`opencontractserver/shared/mixins.py`)
- **PostgreSQL full-text search** on Annotation: Added `search_vector` (`SearchVectorField`) with GIN index and a database trigger that auto-populates tsvector from `raw_text` on INSERT/UPDATE. Replaces `LIKE '%term%'` (`icontains`) with indexed tsvector matching for 100x+ faster text search at scale (`opencontractserver/annotations/models.py`)
- **Hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: New `CoreAnnotationVectorStore.hybrid_search()` method runs vector similarity and full-text search in parallel, then fuses results using RRF (k=60). Semantic search GraphQL resolver now uses hybrid search for improved result quality (`opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/core_vector_stores.py`, `config/graphql/search_queries.py`)
- **RRF utility function** (`opencontractserver/utils/search.py`): Generic `reciprocal_rank_fusion()` that merges any number of ranked lists
- **Search constants** (`opencontractserver/constants/search.py`): `HNSW_M`, `HNSW_EF_CONSTRUCTION`, `RRF_K`, `HYBRID_SEARCH_OVERSAMPLE_FACTOR`, `FTS_CONFIG`
- **pgvector PostgreSQL extension upgraded to 0.8.0** (installed via Docker, not the Python package): Enables iterative index scans for filtered ANN queries (prevents result loss when combining vector search with `WHERE` clauses like `embedder_path` filtering). Database default set via `ALTER DATABASE ... SET hnsw.iterative_scan = 'relaxed_order'` in `init.sql` (`compose/production/postgres/Dockerfile`, `compose/production/postgres/init.sql`)
- **PostgreSQL tuning for vector workloads**: Added `shared_buffers`, `maintenance_work_mem`, `effective_cache_size`, `work_mem`, `max_parallel_maintenance_workers`, `random_page_cost`, and `effective_io_concurrency` to all Docker Compose files. Added `shm_size` for parallel HNSW index builds (`local.yml`, `production.yml`, `test.yml`)
- **Pinned pgvector Python package** to `>=0.4.0` for `HnswIndex` support (`requirements/base.txt`)
- **Expanded valid embedding dimensions** in `CoreAnnotationVectorStore`: Search methods now accept 1024 and 2048 dimensions in addition to existing 384, 768, 1536, 3072, 4096
- **Added 2048-dimension support** to conversation and message vector search methods (`opencontractserver/conversations/models.py`)
- **GraphQL annotation mention search** now uses full-text search via `SearchQuery` on GIN-indexed `search_vector` instead of `raw_text__icontains` (`config/graphql/search_queries.py`)

- **IconPicker Lucide Rebuild (SUI Migration Step 3)**: Replaced the Semantic UI icon catalog with a curated Lucide icon catalog (~440 icons across 16 categories). New `IconPickerModal` component displays Lucide icons in a searchable, category-filtered grid with live preview. New `IconDropdown` component provides a compact trigger that opens the modal. Updated `iconCompat.ts` with dynamic fallback resolution so `resolveIcon()` supports all Lucide icons via `kebabToPascal` conversion against the full `lucide-react` export. Legacy SUI icon names remain backward-compatible through the existing `SEMANTIC_TO_LUCIDE` mapping. Includes 16 Playwright component tests and automated documentation screenshots. (`frontend/src/components/widgets/icon-picker/icons.ts`, `frontend/src/components/widgets/icon-picker/IconPickerModal.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/widgets/icon-picker/IconDropdown.tsx`, `frontend/src/utils/iconCompat.ts`)

### Changed

- Removed `django-ratelimit` dependency from `requirements/base.txt` — all rate limiting now handled by `config.ratelimit`
- `config/admin_auth/views.py`: Replaced `django_ratelimit.decorators.ratelimit` with `config.ratelimit.decorators.view_ratelimit`
- `opencontractserver/mcp/server.py`: Replaced custom `RateLimiter` class with unified `check_mcp_rate_limit`; added `ContextVar` for ASGI scope propagation
- `opencontractserver/mcp/permissions.py`: Removed `RateLimiter` class (moved to shared package)
- `opencontractserver/mcp/telemetry.py`: `get_client_ip_from_scope` now delegates to shared `config.ratelimit.keys`
- Removed `X-RateLimit-*` response headers that `django-ratelimit` previously set on GraphQL responses — the new engine communicates rate limit state through `RateLimitExceeded` errors (GraphQL), `RATE_LIMITED` WebSocket frames, or HTTP 429 status (views)
- Removed `RATELIMIT_ENABLE` dead-code setting from `config/settings/ratelimit.py` — the engine only checks `RATELIMIT_DISABLE`

- **Pipeline Component Management Redesign**: Separated component management from filetype default assignment in the Pipeline Configuration UI. New `enabled_components` JSON field on `PipelineSettings` tracks which components are available. Frontend splits into two sections: ComponentLibrary (flat filterable list with enable/disable toggles, search, stage filter chips) and FiletypeDefaults (MIME type rows with parser/embedder/thumbnailer dropdowns). Removed old stage-centric layout with MIME type filter buttons. (`opencontractserver/documents/models.py`, `config/graphql/pipeline_types.py`, `config/graphql/pipeline_queries.py`, `config/graphql/pipeline_settings_mutations.py`, `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/admin/system_settings/ComponentLibrary.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/admin/system_settings/FiletypeDefaults.tsx`)
- **Clean corpus landing page with Power User mode toggle**: Default corpus view is now a full-page landing without sidebar navigation, providing a cleaner experience for anonymous browsers and casual users. Users with edit permissions see a "Power User" toggle (`?mode=power` URL param) to access the full sidebar+tabs layout (`frontend/src/views/Corpuses.tsx`)
- **Recent discussions feed on corpus landing page**: New `RecentDiscussions` component shows 2-3 latest discussion threads below the "View Details" button, making community activity visible even to anonymous users (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome/RecentDiscussions.tsx`)
- **Inline discussions view**: New `?view=discussions` URL state enables viewing the full discussion thread list and thread detail directly from the corpus home, without switching to the Discussions tab (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome/CorpusDiscussionsInlineView.tsx`)
- `updateModeParam` navigation utility for managing the `?mode=` URL parameter (`frontend/src/utils/navigationUtils.ts`)
- Extended `CorpusDetailViewType` to include `"discussions"` alongside `"landing"` and `"details"` (`frontend/src/graphql/cache.ts`)
- Screenshot tests for new landing view states: clean view, discussion feed, empty discussions, and power user mode (`frontend/tests/CorpusHome.ct.tsx`, `frontend/tests/CorpusTabs.ct.tsx`)

#### Security Headers Middleware (CSP, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)

- Added `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` in `config/middleware.py` that attaches `Content-Security-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy` headers to every HTTP response; Referrer-Policy is handled by Django's built-in `SecurityMiddleware` via `SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY`
- Middleware positioned after `SecurityMiddleware` so it is the final authority on security headers in the response phase
- CSP directives configured via `SECURE_CSP_DIRECTIVES` dict in `config/settings/base.py` — covers `default-src`, `script-src` (with `blob:` for PDF.js worker fallback), `style-src`, `img-src`, `font-src`, `connect-src`, `worker-src`, `object-src`, `frame-ancestors`, `base-uri`, and `form-action`
- When `USE_AUTH0=True`, the Auth0 tenant domain is automatically added to `connect-src` and `script-src` with input sanitization via `validate_csp_domain()` (rejects domains containing spaces or semicolons to prevent CSP injection)
- Auth0 domain validation extracted into `config.middleware.validate_csp_domain()` for independent testability
- Permissions-Policy disables `camera`, `microphone`, `geolocation`, `payment`, `usb`, `magnetometer`, `gyroscope`, and `accelerometer` via `SECURE_PERMISSIONS_POLICY`
- Header values are pre-built once at middleware init for zero per-request overhead
- Local dev CSP (`config/settings/local.py`) scopes WebSocket `connect-src` to `localhost` instead of bare `wss:`/`ws:` scheme sources, with documented Auth0 domain interaction
- Tests in `opencontractserver/tests/test_security_headers_middleware.py` — unit tests, integration test against `/api/health/`, and `validate_csp_domain()` tests

#### Expand Corpus Import Test Coverage (Closes #999)

- Rewrote `test_corpus_import.py` with proper `TransactionTestCase` base class (previously `ImportCorpusTestCase` with no parent, never discovered by test runners)
- Fixed `FieldFile.save()` call signature in test setup helper (was passing `ContentFile` as `name` instead of `(name, content)`)
- Grouped read-only assertions into 2 test methods using `subTest` to reduce import pipeline executions from 15 to 5
- **Label integrity**: Validates all 107 labels (79 text + 28 doc) with correct color, icon, description, type, and labelset membership
- **Annotation validation**: Verifies raw text, page numbers, bounding box coordinates, token references, and label associations for all 6 annotations
- **Relationship verification**: Tests `import_relationships()` with single and multiple source/target annotations, plus structural flag preservation

- Expanded corpus forking test suite with field-level data integrity checks (Closes #998)

### Fixed

#### Missing embedding dimensions in VALID_EMBEDDING_DIMS

- `VALID_EMBEDDING_DIMS` was missing dimensions 1024, 2048, and 4096, causing validation failures for embedders that produce these common dimensions (e.g., some OpenAI and Cohere models). Added missing entries to `VALID_EMBEDDING_DIMS` and `DIM_TO_FIELD_MAP` in `opencontractserver/constants/search.py`.

#### Fix My Documents Corpus Not Navigable Due to Missing Slugs

- **Root cause**: Migration 0038 created personal corpuses using historical models which bypass `Corpus.save()` slug auto-generation, leaving `slug=NULL`. The frontend requires both `corpus.slug` and `creator.slug` to build navigation URLs (`/c/<user>/<corpus>`), so clicking "My Documents" logged "Cannot navigate to corpus without slugs" and did nothing.
- **Fix (model)**: `Corpus.get_or_create_personal_corpus()` now detects when a returned corpus lacks a slug and triggers `save()` to backfill it on access (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:518-521`).
- **Fix (migration)**: Added data migration `0043_backfill_corpus_slugs` that backfills slugs for all existing corpuses and users missing them (`opencontractserver/corpuses/migrations/0043_backfill_corpus_slugs.py`).

#### Skip redundant document re-parsing during corpus import

- Set `processing_started` on standalone documents created via `create_document_from_export_data()` to prevent the post_save signal from triggering `ingest_doc` (`opencontractserver/utils/importing.py:323`)
- Imported documents already have PAWLS data from the export; re-parsing wasted resources and failed in environments without a parser service

#### Tighten JSON Field Validation for Malformed Input (Closes #1001)

- **Root cause**: `CustomJSONFieldFormTests.TestForm` used `NullableJSONField()` (a model field) instead of `UTF8JSONFormField` (a form field). Django's `Form` metaclass silently ignores model fields, so the form had zero fields and `is_valid()` always returned `True` — masking the fact that malformed JSON was never validated.
- **Fix**: Changed `TestForm.json_field` to `UTF8JSONFormField(required=False)` so form validation actually runs through Django's `forms.JSONField.to_python()`, which raises `ValidationError` on `json.JSONDecodeError` (`opencontractserver/tests/test_custom_fields.py:76`).
- **Re-enabled**: `test_form_with_invalid_json` now asserts that `'not json'` is correctly rejected (`opencontractserver/tests/test_custom_fields.py:90-92`).
- **Added**: `test_formfield_rejects_invalid_json` and `test_formfield_accepts_valid_json` integration tests on `NullableJSONFieldTests` to verify the model field's `formfield()` method produces a form field that properly validates JSON (`opencontractserver/tests/test_custom_fields.py:63-71`).

### Changed

#### Deployment: migration 0063 backfill may need a maintenance window for large deployments

- Operators with >1M annotations should consider running the search_vector backfill (Phase 4 of migration 0063) during a maintenance window. The migration now emits `RAISE NOTICE` progress messages so operators can monitor backfill progress in PostgreSQL logs.
- Production `maintenance_work_mem` reduced from `2GB` to `512MB`. The higher value is only needed during the initial HNSW index build; operators should temporarily increase it for that migration, then revert (`production.yml`).
- `hnsw.ef_search` increased from `40` to `64` to match `ef_construction`, improving recall for legal document search (`compose/production/postgres/init.sql`, migration 0063).

#### Annotation text search now uses PostgreSQL full-text search with English stemming

- The annotation mention search (`resolve_search_annotations_for_mention`) and the semantic search resolver now use `SearchQuery` on a GIN-indexed `search_vector` column instead of `raw_text__icontains`. This means text queries now match English-stemmed forms (e.g., searching "contract" also matches "contracting" and "contracted") rather than requiring exact substring matches. This is a semantic behavior change for users accustomed to exact substring matching on `raw_text`. See `config/graphql/search_queries.py`.

#### Triage and Clean Up TODO/FIXME Comments (Closes #971)

- Removed 62 TODO/FIXME/HACK annotations across 43 backend and frontend files
- Replaced vague TODOs with `NOTE(deferred):` comments explaining deferral reasoning
- Deleted stale comments referencing non-existent files, already-implemented features, and empty test stubs
- Fixed typo: "whould" → "should" in `test_permissioning.py`
- Removed `console.log` debug statement in `ModernDocumentItem.tsx`
- Deleted empty test stub file `test_doc_analysis_tasks.py`
- Consolidated redundant `logger.debug()` calls in `utils/files.py`

#### Extract Magic Numbers to Constants Files (Closes #970)

- Replaced hardcoded upload limit, truncation lengths, DPI, and title limits with named constants in `constants/document_processing.py` and `constants/llm_tools.py`
- Reused existing `MAX_PROCESSING_ERROR_LENGTH`/`MAX_PROCESSING_TRACEBACK_LENGTH` in `corpuses/models.py`

#### GraphQL Module Modularization (Closes #972)

- Split `graphene_types.py` (3,717→107 lines), `mutations.py` (6,229→405 lines), `queries.py` (4,408→54 lines) into domain-specific files
- Full backward compatibility via re-exports; no logic changes

#### Consolidate Duplicate String Truncation Utilities (Closes #976)

- Added `truncate()` helper in `opencontractserver/utils/text.py` and named constants in `constants/truncation.py`
- Replaced inline truncation across `core_tools.py`, `doc_tasks.py`, and `corpuses/models.py`

#### Break Up Large Frontend Components (Closes #977)

- Split 5 large components: StyledContainers (2,115→12), SystemSettings (2,616→1,108), CorpusChat (2,347→1,346), DocumentKnowledgeBase (3,363→2,322), ChatTray (2,215→1,772)
- Extracted shared chat WebSocket types into canonical `chat/types.ts`; renamed duplicate ConversationListView components; replaced `any` types with explicit typed properties

### Removed

#### Deprecated Semantic UI React Components and Icon Picker (PR #1009)

- Deleted 103 files (~20,900 lines) of deprecated frontend components, hooks, and tests that had been fully replaced by OS Legal styled equivalents
- Removed icon picker widget (`IconSelector.tsx`, `IconDropdown.tsx`, `IconPickerModal.tsx`, `icons.ts`, `styles.module.css`)
- Removed unused Semantic UI wrapper components: `DocTypeLabelDisplay`, `DocTypeLabels`, `LabelSelector`, `SemanticSidebar`, and related CSS
- Removed deprecated layout components: `AnnotatorSidebar.tsx`, `DropdownActionButton.tsx`, `CorpusCards.tsx`, `TreeItemDisplay.tsx`
- Removed dead modals: `SelectCorpusAnalyzerModal.tsx`, `SelectExtractFieldsModal.tsx`, `EditExtractModal.tsx`, `NewEditAnalysisModal.tsx`, `SelectDocumentFieldsetModal.tsx`
- Removed deprecated annotator hooks and display components: `useVisibleRelationships`, `useAnnotationDisplay`, `useAnnotationSelection`, `usePageAnnotations`, `RelationshipList`, `ActionBar`, `AnnotationSummary`, and others
- Removed legacy notification components: `NotificationBell`, `NotificationCenter`, `NotificationDropdown`, `NotificationItem`
- Removed deprecated thread components: `MentionPicker`, `ResourceMentionPicker`, `ModerationControls`, `ModeratorBadge`, `ReputationDisplay`, and associated hooks
- Removed orphaned CSS files: `DocTypeLabelDisplayStyles.css`, `DocTypeLabels.css`, `LabelSelector.css`
- Removed associated test files for deleted components

### Added

#### Replace Mock Data with Real User Query in @mention Dropdown (Closes #1002)

- **useMentionUsers hook** (`frontend/src/components/threads/hooks/useMentionUsers.ts`): Replaced hardcoded mock users with real `SEARCH_USERS_FOR_MENTION` GraphQL query. Added 300ms debounced input to reduce excessive API calls and minimum character threshold (2 chars). Hook now returns `{ users, loading, error }` instead of just `MentionUser[]`.
- **MentionPicker component** (`frontend/src/components/threads/MentionPicker.tsx`): Added loading and error state rendering. Shows "Searching users..." during query execution and "Failed to load users" on errors. Added `loading` and `error` optional props to `MentionPickerProps`.

#### Deep Linking and Context Menu for Text/PDF Annotators (Closes #958)

- Copy Link actions in PDF (`SelectionLayer.tsx`) and TXT (`TxtAnnotator.tsx`) context menus encode selections as `?tb=` deep link URLs
- URL-driven annotation selection from chat sources (`ChatTray.tsx`); delete button for processing documents (`ModernDocumentItem.tsx`)

#### Corpus Export Test Coverage (Closes #997)

- Added `test_exported_document_structure` to validate exported document data structure: top-level keys, PAWLS page schema, annotation structure with bounding boxes and token references, and PDF burn-in validity (`opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_export.py`)
- Added `test_round_trip_consistency` to compare exported data against original import fixture: document title, content, PAWLS page dimensions and token counts, annotation count, raw text, label names (mapped through label lookups), and bounding box coordinates (`opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_export.py`)
- Added `test_exported_label_names_match_fixture` to verify exported label name sets match the labels actually used in the import fixture (`opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_export.py`)
- Loaded import fixture data in setUp for round-trip comparison, replacing the previous TODO placeholder (`opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_export.py:62`)
- Cleaned up existing tests by removing verbose print statements and TODO comments

#### Expand burn_doc_annotations Test (Closes #1000)

- Added `test_burn_doc_annotations_with_text_labels` to exercise the text-label PDF burning code path with TOKEN_LABEL fixtures and bounding-box annotation data (`opencontractserver/tests/test_doc_tasks.py`)
- Validates output PDF contains highlight annotations with correct subtype, label text, and non-empty base64-encoded content
- Validates `doc_export` JSON contains expected `doc_labels` and `labelled_text` entries
- Renamed existing test to `test_burn_doc_annotations_doc_labels_only` for clarity

#### Test Coverage for Untested Backend Modules (Closes #975)

- Unit tests for feedback, shared utils, constants, types, and MCP extended modules (`opencontractserver/tests/`)

### Fixed

#### Code Review Fixes for Text Block Deep Linking (#958)

- Document resolution via corpus membership (`DocumentPath`) instead of `creator=owner`; simplified default path to return already-resolved doc
- Cross-document source click flash fix; `useClearTextBlockOnInteraction` hook consolidation; clipboard `.catch()` for non-HTTPS; dead code removal

#### Document Version Selector UI Cleanup (Closes #964)

- Removed unused query fields (`versionCount`, `hasVersionHistory`, etc.); added WAI-ARIA keyboard navigation; safe `v?` fallback during load
- Backend validation for invalid version numbers (≤ 0); isCurrent JSDoc; updated test mocks and new keyboard nav tests

#### Rollup Vulnerability (Closes #973)

- Pinned `rollup: "^4.59.0"` via yarn resolutions to fix 3 high-severity path traversal advisories
- **Result**: rollup updated from 4.53.1 to 4.59.0, eliminating all 3 rollup-related audit advisories

### Added

#### Worker Upload Management UI and Documentation (#955)

- **GraphQL queries**: `workerAccounts`, `corpusAccessTokens`, `workerDocumentUploads` resolvers with proper permission checks (superuser-only for accounts, superuser/corpus-creator for tokens and uploads) (`config/graphql/queries.py`)
- **ReactivateWorkerAccount mutation**: Allows superusers to re-enable previously deactivated worker accounts (`config/graphql/worker_mutations.py`)
- **Worker Account management page**: New admin page at `/admin/worker-accounts` for creating, listing, and activating/deactivating worker service accounts (`frontend/src/components/admin/WorkerAccountManagement.tsx`)
- **Worker Access Tokens section in Corpus Settings**: Corpus creators and superusers can view, create, and revoke access tokens scoped to their corpus. Includes one-time key display with copy-to-clipboard (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/settings/WorkerTokensSection.tsx`)
- **Documentation walkthrough**: End-to-end guide covering account creation, token management, document upload (with curl/Python examples), metadata format reference, rate limiting, error handling, and security model (`docs/worker_uploads/walkthrough.md`)
- **Component tests**: Playwright component tests for WorkerAccountManagement with automated documentation screenshots

#### Document Version Selector End-to-End Documentation (Closes #954)

- **User-facing guide**: `docs/features/document_versioning.md` — covers version creation workflow, visual status indicators (gray/blue/orange badges), Version History Panel usage, and Trash folder recovery
- **Documentation screenshots**: Added `docScreenshot` calls to capture five key UI states:
  - `versioning--badge--single-version` — gray badge for documents without history (`frontend/tests/VersionBadge.ct.tsx`)
  - `versioning--badge--latest-version` — blue badge showing version count (`frontend/tests/VersionBadge.ct.tsx`)
  - `versioning--badge--older-version` — orange badge for outdated versions (`frontend/tests/VersionBadge.ct.tsx`)
  - `versioning--history-panel--with-versions` — already captured in `frontend/tests/VersionHistoryPanel.ct.tsx`
  - `versioning--trash-folder--restore-ui` — deleted document recovery interface (`frontend/tests/TrashFolderView.ct.tsx`)

### Changed

#### Worker Upload Permission Expansion (#955)

- `CreateCorpusAccessTokenMutation` and `RevokeCorpusAccessTokenMutation` now allow corpus creators (not just superusers) to manage tokens scoped to their own corpora
- GlobalSettingsPanel refreshed with OS Legal design tokens and lucide-react icons, replacing Semantic UI dependencies

#### Auth0 Refresh Token Migration (#955)

- **DEPLOYMENT NOTE**: `useRefreshTokens: true` is now enabled in the Auth0 SDK configuration (`frontend/src/index.tsx`). Deployments using Auth0 **must** enable "Refresh Token Rotation" in the Auth0 dashboard before deploying this change, or silent authentication will fail for all users.

### Fixed

#### Document Version Structural Annotation Set Inheritance

- **Bug**: When a document was updated with new content (different hash), `import_document()` unconditionally inherited the old version's `structural_annotation_set`. This caused the parser's `_create_structural_annotation_set()` to short-circuit (early return at `pipeline/base/parser.py:299`), leaving freshly-parsed structural annotations orphaned — never migrated into a set.
- **Fix**: `opencontractserver/documents/versioning.py:224-231` — `structural_annotation_set` is now only inherited when the content hash is unchanged. When content changes, the field is set to `None` so the parser creates a fresh `StructuralAnnotationSet` during ingestion.
- **Tests**: `opencontractserver/tests/test_structural_annotation_portability.py` — replaced single test with two: one verifying `None` on changed content, one verifying inheritance on identical content.

### Added

#### Annotation Versioning and Document Version-Aware Deep Linking

- **Version-aware document resolution**: `documentInCorpusBySlugs` GraphQL query now accepts optional `versionNumber` parameter to resolve a specific historical version of a document (`config/graphql/queries.py`)
- **Corpus versions field**: New `corpusVersions(corpusId)` field on `DocumentType` returns all versions of a document in a corpus with version number, document ID, slug, creation date, and current status (`config/graphql/graphene_types.py`)
- **`CorpusVersionInfoType` GraphQL type**: New type for version selector data returned by `corpusVersions` field
- **`?v=N` URL parameter**: Deep links to documents now support a `?v=N` query parameter to view a specific version (e.g., `/d/user/corpus/doc?v=1&ann=123`)
- **`selectedDocVersion` reactive var**: New URL-driven state variable in `frontend/src/graphql/cache.ts` synced bidirectionally via CentralRouteManager Phases 2 and 4
- **CentralRouteManager version support**: Phase 1 passes version to GraphQL resolution, Phase 2 parses `?v=` into reactive var, Phase 4 syncs back to URL (`frontend/src/routing/CentralRouteManager.tsx`)
- **`DocumentVersionSelector` component**: Inline version badge and dropdown in document header that shows available versions and allows switching between them (`frontend/src/components/documents/DocumentVersionSelector.tsx`)
- **Navigation utilities**: `QueryParams` interface and `buildQueryParams` now support `version` field for URL construction (`frontend/src/utils/navigationUtils.ts`)
- **Routing documentation**: Updated `docs/frontend/routing_system.md` with version parameter documentation, examples, and reactive var listing

#### Worker Document Upload System

- **New Django app** `opencontractserver.worker_uploads` — enables external document-processing workers to upload fully ingested, annotated, and embedded documents to a target corpus via REST API
- **Service account model** (`WorkerAccount`): dedicated machine identity with auto-created Django User for permission compatibility. Created via `createWorkerAccount` GraphQL mutation (superuser only)
- **Corpus-scoped access tokens** (`CorpusAccessToken`): cryptographically random 256-bit tokens scoped to a single corpus, with configurable expiry and per-token rate limiting. Created via `createCorpusAccessToken` GraphQL mutation
- **Hashed token storage**: tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes — plaintext shown only once at creation via `create_token()`. Auth backend hashes incoming keys before DB lookup (`opencontractserver/worker_uploads/models.py`, `auth.py`)
- **DRF authentication backend** (`WorkerTokenAuthentication`): validates `Authorization: WorkerKey <token>` headers, hashes token and checks validity, expiry, and account status (`opencontractserver/worker_uploads/auth.py`)
- **REST upload endpoint** (`POST /api/worker-uploads/documents/`): accepts multipart form data (file + JSON metadata), stages uploads in database, returns 202 Accepted immediately. Status polling via `GET /api/worker-uploads/documents/<id>/` and listing via `GET /api/worker-uploads/documents/list/`
- **Upload format** (`WorkerDocumentUploadMetadataType`): extends V2 export format with pre-computed embeddings (`embedder_path` + document/annotation vectors), target path/folder placement, and inline label definitions for auto-creation (`opencontractserver/types/dicts.py`)
- **Database-backed queue** (`WorkerDocumentUpload`): staging table with PENDING/PROCESSING/COMPLETED/FAILED status tracking, avoids Redis saturation for high-volume uploads (millions of documents)
- **Batch processor task** (`process_pending_uploads`): Celery task on dedicated `worker_uploads` queue using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for concurrent processing without conflicts. Configurable batch size via `WORKER_UPLOAD_BATCH_SIZE` setting. Self-reschedules when more work exists
- **Multi-queue architecture**: worker upload processing runs on dedicated `worker_uploads` Celery queue, preserving capacity on the default queue for regular user operations
- **Pre-computed embedding storage**: workers can include embeddings in upload metadata; stored directly via bulk_create without re-running embedder models. Supports all vector dimensions (384–4096)
- **Corpus creator ownership**: all documents, annotations, and labels created via worker uploads are owned by the corpus creator (not the service account), ensuring correct permission inheritance
- **GraphQL management mutations**: `createWorkerAccount`, `deactivateWorkerAccount`, `createCorpusAccessToken`, `revokeCorpusAccessToken` (all superuser-only) in `config/graphql/worker_mutations.py`
- **Celery task routing**: `CELERY_TASK_ROUTES` canonicalized in one place with guard comment (`config/settings/base.py`)
- **Settings-based Beat schedule**: `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` for worker upload drain (60s interval), replacing fragile data migration approach
- **File size limit**: `MAX_WORKER_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES` setting (default 256 MB) enforced at upload endpoint
- **Filename sanitization**: worker-supplied document titles are sanitized before use as filenames, stripping path traversal characters and null bytes

### Technical Details

- New files: `opencontractserver/worker_uploads/{models,views,auth,serializers,tasks,urls,apps}.py`, `config/graphql/worker_mutations.py`
- Migrations: `0001_initial.py` (models), `0002_setup_beat_schedule.py` (cleanup old DB schedule), `0003_hash_token_keys.py` (SHA-256 token hashing)
- Settings: `WORKER_UPLOAD_BATCH_SIZE` (default 50), `MAX_WORKER_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES` (default 256 MB), `CELERY_TASK_ROUTES` for queue isolation, `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` for periodic drain
- Tests: `opencontractserver/tests/test_worker_uploads.py` covering models, hashed token auth, REST endpoints, file size limits, batch processor, filename sanitization, null corpus creator guard, and GraphQL mutations

#### Corpus Export Format Specification and Validation Utility

- **Format specification**: `docs/architecture/corpus-export-format-spec.md` — complete reference for V1 and V2 corpus export ZIP format covering all data.json fields, PAWLs structure, referential integrity rules, security limits, and import behavior
- **Standalone validator**: `opencontractserver/utils/validate_export.py` — checks structural and referential integrity of export ZIPs without requiring Django or a database. Usable as CLI (`python -m opencontractserver.utils.validate_export corpus.zip`) or library (`validate_export()` / `validate_data_json()`)
- **Validation checks**: ZIP↔data.json file consistency, label definitions and type constraints, annotation token/page index bounds, annotation bounds non-negativity, structural set hash consistency, folder hierarchy (circular reference detection, path consistency), document path references, relationship label type enforcement (including structural relationships), V2 required top-level fields, conversation/message/vote cross-references, unknown version warnings
- **Test suite**: `opencontractserver/tests/test_validate_export.py` — 48 pure-Python tests covering all validation paths including CLI entry point

### Changed

#### Migrate from deprecated PyPDF2 to pypdf (Closes #938)

- Replaced `PyPDF2==3.0.1` with `pypdf` in `requirements/base.txt`
- Removed redundant `pypdf` entry from `requirements/local.txt` (now provided by base)
- Updated imports in `opencontractserver/utils/files.py`, `opencontractserver/utils/etl.py`, and `opencontractserver/tests/test_pdf_redaction.py`
- Removed unused `add_highlight_to_page` function from `opencontractserver/utils/files.py` (used deprecated `_addObject` API, never called)

#### Django 4.2 → 5.2 LTS Upgrade

- **Django version**: Upgraded from Django 4.2.24 to 5.2.11 (LTS)
  - `requirements/base.txt`, `requirements/local.txt`, `requirements/production.txt`
- **STORAGES migration**: Replaced deprecated `STATICFILES_STORAGE` and `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` settings with the unified `STORAGES` dict (required since Django 5.1)
  - `config/settings/base.py` — LOCAL, AWS, and GCP storage backends all migrated
  - `config/settings/test.py` — test storage configuration migrated
  - `opencontractserver/tests/base.py` — test `@override_settings` migrated
  - `opencontractserver/tests/test_agent_search_tools.py` — all `@override_settings` decorators migrated
  - `opencontractserver/tests/test_storage_backends.py` — assertions updated to check `STORAGES` dict
- **Removed `USE_L10N` setting**: This setting was removed in Django 5.0 (localization is always enabled)
  - `config/settings/base.py:78`
- **Removed `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` setting**: This setting was removed in Django 5.0 (modern browsers handle XSS filtering natively)
  - `config/settings/base.py:503-504`
- **Replaced `pytz` with `datetime.timezone`**: Django 5.0+ uses `zoneinfo` instead of `pytz`
  - `opencontractserver/users/tasks.py` — replaced `pytz.utc.localize()` with `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)`
  - Removed `pytz` from direct requirements in `requirements/base.txt`
- **Updated third-party packages for Django 5.2 compatibility**:
  - `graphene-django`: 3.2.2 → 3.2.3 (adds Django 5.1+ support; Django 5.2 not officially supported — tracked via TODO)
  - `django-stubs`: 4.2.7 → 5.2.0
  - `djangorestframework-stubs`: 1.8.0 → 3.15.4
  - `django-celery-beat`: 2.6.0 → 2.8.1 (adds Django 5.2 support)
  - `django-filter`: 24.3 → 25.1 (adds Django 5.2 support)
  - `django-model-utils`: 4.3.1 → 5.0.0 (adds Django 5.x support; no direct imports in codebase — transitive dependency)
  - `django-crispy-forms`: 2.4 → 2.5 (adds Django 5.2 support)
  - `django-cte`: 2.0.0 → 3.0.0 (adds Django 5.2 support, fixes ambiguous column names; LOUTER breaking change does not affect this project — no `_join_type` usage found)
  - `django-environ`: 0.12.0 → 0.13.0 (adds Django 5.2 support)
- **Removed `django-debug-toolbar`**: Was never wired into INSTALLED_APPS or MIDDLEWARE; removed unused dependency and associated INTERNAL_IPS config from `config/settings/local.py`
- **Replaced Collectfast with Collectfasta** (production static file collection):
  - `Collectfast==2.2.0` was archived/unmaintained (last release 2020), incompatible with Django 5.x `STORAGES` setting
  - Switched to `collectfasta>=3.2.0`, an actively maintained fork tested with Django 5.2.3
  - `requirements/production.txt` — package swap
  - `config/settings/production.py` — updated INSTALLED_APPS reference
  - `config/settings/base.py` — renamed `COLLECTFAST_STRATEGY` to `COLLECTFASTA_STRATEGY` and updated paths from `collectfast.strategies.*` to `collectfasta.strategies.*`

### Security

#### Dependency Security Updates

- **Django 4.2.24 → 4.2.28 (now 5.2.11)**: CVEs fixed by the 5.2.11 LTS release include multiple SQL injection vectors (CVE-2025-59681, CVE-2025-64459, CVE-2025-13372, CVE-2026-1312, CVE-2026-1287, CVE-2026-1207), directory traversal (CVE-2025-59682), DoS attacks (CVE-2025-64458, CVE-2025-64460), and user enumeration timing attack (CVE-2025-13473)
  - Updated in `requirements/base.txt`, `requirements/local.txt`, `requirements/production.txt`
- **cryptography 46.0.3 → 46.0.5**: Fixes CVE-2026-26007 — missing subgroup validation in ECDSA/ECDH public key loading for SECT curves, enabling signature forgery and private key leakage
  - Updated in `requirements/base.txt`
- **axios ^1.12.0 → ^1.13.5**: Fixes DoS vulnerability via `__proto__` key in `mergeConfig`
  - Updated in `frontend/package.json`
- **Removed unused `worker-loader`**: Webpack-specific package unused in Vite project; removal eliminates transitive `ajv@6.12.6` ReDoS vulnerability (via `worker-loader > schema-utils > ajv`)
  - Removed from `frontend/package.json`

### Fixed

#### TxtAnnotator Infinite Re-render Loop (Closes #933)

- **Unstable default parameter**: `chatSources = []` in `TxtAnnotator` component props created a new array reference on every render, triggering infinite re-renders via `useEffect` dependency arrays when the prop was not explicitly passed (`frontend/src/components/annotator/renderers/txt/TxtAnnotator.tsx:335`)
- Extracted `ChatSourceHighlight` interface and defined module-level `EMPTY_CHAT_SOURCES` constant as the default value, ensuring referential stability across renders

#### Follow-up Text Annotation Fixes (Closes #911)

- **Double-scroll bug**: `toggleSelectedAnnotation` in `AnnotatorSidebar.tsx:758` and `RelationshipList.tsx:106` called `scrollIntoView` for all annotation types, including text span annotations which already scroll via `TxtAnnotator`'s own `selectedAnnotations` useEffect. This caused two competing scroll animations. Fixed by guarding with `instanceof ServerTokenAnnotation` check.
- **Phantom ID tracking**: `TxtAnnotator.tsx:366` built `currentIds` from all visible annotations before verifying DOM elements existed. Annotations without rendered spans became "ghost" IDs tracked in `registeredAnnotationIdsRef` but never actually registered. Fixed by only adding IDs to the tracking set after confirming a DOM element was found and registered.
- **Page number display regression**: `HighlightItem.tsx` and `RelationHighlightItem.tsx` now use `(annotation instanceof ServerTokenAnnotation || annotation.page > 0)` to show page labels. PDF token annotations always display page labels (page is always meaningful), while span annotations only display them when `page > 0` (since `page=0` is a sentinel for "no page concept applies").
- **TypeScript type narrowing**: `HighlightItem.tsx:176` stored `instanceof` check in an intermediate boolean variable, preventing TypeScript's control-flow narrowing. Inlined the `instanceof` check directly in the conditional.

#### BaseChunkedParser Robustness and Consistency (Closes #926)

- **Config ValueError not wrapped**: `calculate_page_chunks` raises `ValueError` for invalid `max_pages_per_chunk`/`min_pages_for_chunking`, but the call in `_parse_document_impl` was unwrapped. Now caught and re-raised as `DocumentParsingError(is_transient=False)` (`opencontractserver/pipeline/base/chunked_parser.py`)
- **Small-document annotations unprefixed**: Single-chunk documents returned directly from `_parse_chunk_with_retry` without passing through `_reassemble_chunk_results`, resulting in unprefixed annotation/relationship IDs. Now all results consistently receive `c0_` prefixed IDs (`opencontractserver/pipeline/base/chunked_parser.py`)
- **Uncovered backoff cap branch**: `MAX_CHUNK_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` cap was never exercised by tests. Added test with `chunk_retry_limit=4` that verifies backoff values `[5, 10, 20, 30]` where the 4th retry hits the 30s cap (`opencontractserver/tests/test_chunked_parser.py`)
- **Theoretical race in concurrent test**: `slow_chunks_started.is_set()` assertion could fail on heavily loaded CI. Added `slow_chunks_started.wait(timeout=2)` before the assertion (`opencontractserver/tests/test_chunked_parser.py`)

#### Context Guardrails for LLM Conversation Management (Closes #907)

- **`truncate_tool_output` negative slice defense** (`opencontractserver/llms/context_guardrails.py`): Replaced fragile guard clause with explicit `char_budget = max(0, max_chars - len(notice))` to prevent negative slice indices when `max_chars` is smaller than the truncation notice length
- **Token double-counting across compaction cycles** (`opencontractserver/llms/context_guardrails.py`, `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`): Added `stored_summary_tokens` parameter to `compact_message_history()` so the stored summary is counted in `total_before` (threshold check) but not double-counted in `total_after` (the new summary replaces the old one)
- **Repeating prefix in compaction summaries** (`opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`): Successive compaction cycles no longer accumulate duplicate `COMPACTION_SUMMARY_PREFIX` headers — the merge logic now strips the prefix from both old and new summaries before re-adding it once
- **Fragile sentence extraction in deterministic summary** (`opencontractserver/llms/context_guardrails.py`): Extended the first-sentence regex to split on double-newlines (paragraph boundaries) and newlines before markdown list markers (`-`, `*`, `•`, numbered lists), preventing entire bullet-list responses from being treated as a single sentence
- **Deprecated asyncio pattern in tests** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_context_guardrails.py`): Converted `TestPersistCompactionOptimisticLock` from `asyncio.run()` wrapper calls to native `async def` test methods, removing the unused `asyncio` import
- **Weak truncation test assertions** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_context_guardrails.py`): Strengthened `test_custom_max_chars` and `test_truncation_notice_contains_limit` to assert exact upper-bound length (`<= max_chars`) and verify content starts from the beginning of the input string; added `test_truncated_content_from_beginning_not_end` test
- **CHARS_PER_TOKEN_ESTIMATE docstring inconsistency** (`opencontractserver/constants/context_guardrails.py`): Clarified that the constant is intentionally 3.5 (not 4) to over-count tokens slightly for conservative compaction triggering
- **Missing integrity constraint documentation** (`opencontractserver/conversations/models.py`): Added comment and expanded `help_text` on `compacted_before_message_id` explaining why `BigIntegerField` (not `ForeignKey`) is safe — the `id__gt` filter remains correct even if the cutoff message is deleted
- **Unreachable defensive code** (`opencontractserver/llms/context_guardrails.py`): Added clarifying comment on the `recent_count < 1` guard explaining it is unreachable with default `MIN_RECENT_MESSAGES` but protects against callers passing `min_recent=0`
- **Missing compaction bookmark filter tests** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_context_guardrails.py`): Added `TestCompactionBookmarkDatabaseFilter` with two async tests verifying `get_conversation_messages()` applies `id__gt` filtering when a bookmark is set and skips it when `None`
- **New sentence extraction tests** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_context_guardrails.py`): Added `test_markdown_bullet_list_split` and `test_double_newline_paragraph_split` covering the improved regex

#### MCP Documentation Accuracy (Closes #924)

- **Missing `created` field in tool return docs**: `list_public_corpuses`, `list_documents`, and `list_annotations` all return a `created` ISO 8601 timestamp, but `llms-full.txt` omitted it from the documented return shapes
- **Incorrect annotation label shape**: `list_annotations` return docs showed `label` (string) but the actual response uses `annotation_label: { text, color, label_type }` (object) — updated to match `format_annotation()` in `opencontractserver/mcp/formatters.py`
- **Underdocumented `document://` resource**: The resource description only said "Document metadata and full extracted text" without listing the actual fields. Added field inventory including `text_preview` (first 500 chars), `full_text`, `corpus`, and `created` — critical for agents choosing between preview and full text under context window constraints
- **File**: `frontend/public/llms-full.txt`

#### BaseChunkedParser Cleanup (Closes #914)

- **Duplicate test line**: Removed redundant `PdfReader` assignment in `test_pdf_splitting.py:95`
- **Infinite loop guard**: Added input validation for `max_pages_per_chunk` and `min_pages_for_chunking` in `calculate_page_chunks()` (`opencontractserver/utils/pdf_splitting.py`); added `max_concurrent_chunks` validation in `_parse_document_impl` (`opencontractserver/pipeline/base/chunked_parser.py`)
- **Dead code / ID inconsistency**: Removed single-chunk fast-path short-circuit in `_reassemble_chunk_results()` that returned unprefixed IDs, creating inconsistency with multi-chunk results
- **Flaky test**: Replaced wall-clock timing assertion in `test_concurrent_failure_cancels_remaining` with a shorter sleep to reduce CI flakiness
- **Type safety**: Replaced `type: ignore[return-value]` in `_dispatch_concurrent` with explicit `cast()` call
- **Noisy logging**: Downgraded orphaned parent-child reference log from `warning` to `debug` level — these are expected on virtually every large hierarchical document
- **Backoff cap**: Added `MAX_CHUNK_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` constant (30s) to cap exponential backoff in per-chunk retries (`opencontractserver/constants/document_processing.py`)
- **Missing boundary test**: Added test for exact `min_pages_for_chunking` threshold (75 pages) and clarified docstring semantics
- **Memory trade-off documented**: Added comment explaining concurrent dispatch memory implications
- **Cross-chunk limitation documented**: Enhanced class docstring with follow-up improvement suggestion for section-aware chunk boundaries

### Added

- Unit tests for `HighlightItem` scroll behavior and page label display (`frontend/src/components/annotator/sidebar/__tests__/HighlightItem.scroll.test.tsx`)

### Security

#### Resolve Dependabot Security Advisories (pydantic-ai + ajv)

- **pydantic-ai 0.2.x → 1.x migration**: Upgraded from pydantic-ai 0.2.20 to >=1.56.0,<2 to resolve CVE in older version. Migration includes:
  - `End` import moved from `pydantic_ai.agent` to `pydantic_graph` (`opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`)
  - All 3 `PydanticAIAgent` creation sites migrated from `system_prompt=` to `instructions=` to use the 1.x-recommended parameter that is always included in model requests regardless of message history
  - `griffe>=1.3.2,<2` pin removed (was a transitive workaround only needed for pydantic-ai 0.2.x)
  - Test file updated: `result.data` → `result.output`, `result_type` → `output_type`, `system_prompt` → `instructions` (`opencontractserver/tests/test_pydantic_ai_agents.py`)
  - `openai` bumped from ==1.102.0 to >=2.11.0,<3 (pydantic-ai 1.x requires openai >=2.11.0)
  - `pdf2image` pinned to >=1.16.0 (ancient 0.1.x versions have broken setup.py, caused cascading build failures in CI)
- **ajv ReDoS fix (CVE in ajv <8.17.1)**: Added scoped Yarn resolutions for `@rjsf/validator-ajv8/ajv` and `ajv-formats/ajv` to pin ajv 8.18.0, avoiding conflict with schema-utils which requires ajv 6.x (`frontend/package.json`)

#### IDOR Vulnerabilities Fixed in 4 GraphQL Mutations

- **HIGH**: Fixed information leakage allowing object ID enumeration via different error messages
  - `RemoveAnnotation` (`config/graphql/mutations.py`)
  - `RejectAnnotation` (`config/graphql/mutations.py`)
  - `ApproveAnnotation` (`config/graphql/mutations.py`)
  - `RemoveRelationship` (`config/graphql/mutations.py`)
- **Attack Vector**: Unauthorized users could distinguish between "object doesn't exist" and "object exists but you can't access it" by observing different error responses
- **Impact**: Allowed enumeration of valid annotation/relationship IDs
- **Solution**: All mutations now use `visible_to_user()` pattern with unified error messages; secondary permission checks also return the same unified message
- **Information leakage fix**: Outer exception handlers no longer return `str(e)` to clients; errors are logged server-side only
- **Test Coverage**: Added IDOR protection tests in `test_permission_fixes.py` and `test_voting_mutations_graphql.py`

#### QuerySet Permission Filtering Gaps Fixed

- `DocumentQuerySet.visible_to_user()` and `NoteQuerySet.visible_to_user()` inherited from `PermissionQuerySet` which had guardian permission checks commented out — only checking `is_public` and `creator`
  - `opencontractserver/shared/QuerySets.py` (classes `DocumentQuerySet`, `NoteQuerySet`)
- `AnnotationQuerySet.visible_to_user()` checked document/corpus visibility via `is_public` and `creator` only, missing guardian permission lookups for documents and corpuses
  - `opencontractserver/shared/QuerySets.py` (class `AnnotationQuerySet`)
- **Bug**: Code calling `Model.objects.filter(...).visible_to_user(user)` or `Model.objects.visible_to_user(user)` skipped guardian permission checks, making objects invisible to users with explicit share permissions
- **Impact**: Documents shared via `set_permissions_for_obj_to_user()` were invisible through the QuerySet chain code path; annotations on shared documents/corpuses were invisible; Notes on accessible documents were not visible
- **Fix**: All three QuerySets now override `visible_to_user()` with proper guardian permission table lookups. Documents and Annotations check guardian tables directly; Notes inherit from document + corpus permissions

### Fixed

#### Corpus Export/Import V2: Audit and Roundtrip Fixes

- **SPAN_LABEL and RELATIONSHIP_LABEL missing from label export**: `build_label_lookups()` in `opencontractserver/utils/etl.py` only exported TOKEN_LABEL and DOC_TYPE_LABEL labels. SPAN_LABEL and RELATIONSHIP_LABEL labels were silently dropped, causing annotation and relationship import to fail. Now all four label types are exported.
- **Relationship labels not gathered from Relationship model**: `build_label_lookups()` only queried labels from `Annotation` objects. Labels used exclusively on `Relationship` objects (RELATIONSHIP_LABEL type) were never collected. Added Relationship model queries to capture these labels.
- **Label lookup key mismatch for structural annotations and relationships**: Structural annotations and relationships reference labels by TEXT in exports, but the import label_lookup was keyed by PK strings. Created a text-keyed label lookup (`label_lookup_by_text`) in `_import_corpus()` for use by `import_structural_annotation_set()` and `_import_v2_relationships()`.
  - File: `opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks_v2.py`
- **Document file_type not preserved**: Non-PDF documents (text/plain, etc.) lost their MIME type during export/import since `file_type` was not included in `OpenContractDocExport`. Added `file_type` to export data and import logic.
  - Files: `opencontractserver/types/dicts.py`, `opencontractserver/utils/etl.py`, `opencontractserver/utils/importing.py`
- **Document-level conversations not exported**: `package_conversations()` only exported corpus-level conversations (`chat_with_corpus=corpus`). Document-level conversations (`chat_with_document`) were completely missed. Now both types are exported.
  - File: `opencontractserver/utils/export_v2.py`
- **Conversation export missing permission filtering**: `package_conversations()` exported ALL conversations regardless of the exporting user's permissions. Added `visible_to_user()` filtering for both conversations and messages.
  - File: `opencontractserver/utils/export_v2.py`
- **Conversation fields missing from export/import**: `description`, `is_locked`, `is_pinned` were not exported or imported. Added to both export and import.
- **Message fields missing from export/import**: `parent_message` (threaded replies), `data` (JSON metadata) were not exported or imported. Added to both export and import with two-pass parent re-linking.
- **Timestamps silently discarded on conversation/message import**: Django's `auto_now_add=True` on `created_at` and `auto_now=True` on `updated_at` fields ignored values passed to `create()`. Fixed by using `QuerySet.update()` after creation to patch timestamps.
  - File: `opencontractserver/utils/import_v2.py`
- **include_conversations/include_action_trail not exposed in export mutation**: The V2 export task accepted these parameters but the GraphQL mutation never passed them, hardcoding `False`. Added both as optional mutation arguments.
  - File: `config/graphql/mutations.py`
- **DocumentPath version trees not reconstructed on import**: Exported DocumentPath data (paths, version numbers, folder assignments) was never used during import. Added `_reconstruct_document_paths()` to update auto-created DocumentPaths to match exported path structure.
  - File: `opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks_v2.py`

### Technical Details

- All label types (TOKEN_LABEL, SPAN_LABEL, RELATIONSHIP_LABEL) are now exported in the `text_labels` dict with their actual `label_type` preserved for correct deserialization
- Conversation document hash (`chat_with_document_hash`) is exported alongside the document ID for cross-system re-linking
- Timestamp patching uses `Model.all_objects.filter(pk=obj.pk).update()` to bypass `auto_now`/`auto_now_add` behavior
- Comprehensive test coverage added: `TestLabelTypeExportCompleteness`, `TestDocumentFileTypeRoundTrip`, `TestConversationExportEnhancements`

### Added

#### Chunked Document Processing for Large PDFs

- **New `BaseChunkedParser` abstract class** (`opencontractserver/pipeline/base/chunked_parser.py`): Extends `BaseParser` to transparently split large PDF documents into page-range chunks for independent parsing and reassembly. Documents below a configurable page threshold are processed as a single request (zero overhead). Features:
  - Automatic PDF splitting via pypdf with configurable `max_pages_per_chunk` (default: 50) and `min_pages_for_chunking` (default: 75)
  - Optional concurrent chunk dispatch via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`max_concurrent_chunks`, default: 3)
  - Per-chunk retry with exponential back-off before escalating to Celery-level retry
  - Correct reassembly of PAWLs page indices, annotation page references, `tokensJsons.pageIndex`, annotation/relationship IDs, and parent-child relationships across chunk boundaries
  - `_post_reassemble_hook()` for document-wide post-processing (e.g., image extraction on the full PDF)
- **New PDF splitting utility** (`opencontractserver/utils/pdf_splitting.py`): `get_pdf_page_count()`, `split_pdf_by_page_range()`, `calculate_page_chunks()` — pure functions for PDF page manipulation
- **New chunking constants** (`opencontractserver/constants/document_processing.py`): `DEFAULT_MAX_PAGES_PER_CHUNK`, `DEFAULT_MIN_PAGES_FOR_CHUNKING`, `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_CHUNKS`, `DEFAULT_CHUNK_RETRY_LIMIT`
- **DoclingParser now extends `BaseChunkedParser`** (`opencontractserver/pipeline/parsers/docling_parser_rest.py`): Large documents are automatically split and parsed in chunks. Configurable via `PipelineSettings` (`DOCLING_MAX_PAGES_PER_CHUNK`, `DOCLING_MIN_PAGES_FOR_CHUNKING`, `DOCLING_MAX_CONCURRENT_CHUNKS`). Image extraction runs once on the full PDF after reassembly via `_post_reassemble_hook`.

#### Context Guardrails & Conversation Compaction (Closes #898)

- **Context guardrails constants** (`opencontractserver/constants/context_guardrails.py`): Centralized configuration for model context windows (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), compaction thresholds, tool output limits, and token estimation parameters. Covers 20+ model variants with sensible defaults.
- **Token estimation** (`opencontractserver/llms/context_guardrails.py`): Fast heuristic token counter (~3.5 chars/token) for estimating conversation size without importing heavyweight tokeniser libraries. Intentionally over-estimates to trigger compaction conservatively.
- **Model context window lookup** (`context_guardrails.py`): Resolves model names to context window sizes via exact match then longest-prefix matching, with a 128K default fallback for unknown models.
- **Conversation compaction** (`context_guardrails.py`): When conversation history approaches the context window limit (default 75%), older messages are replaced by a concise summary while preserving recent turns (4–20 messages) verbatim. Supports pluggable summary functions for LLM-based summarization.
- **Tool output truncation** (`context_guardrails.py`, `opencontractserver/llms/tools/pydantic_ai_tools.py`): String outputs from tools are automatically truncated to 50K characters with a notice directing the LLM to use range parameters. Applied at the PydanticAI tool wrapper level so all tools benefit transparently.
- **Per-agent compaction configuration** (`CompactionConfig` dataclass): Added `compaction` field to `AgentConfig` allowing per-conversation overrides of threshold ratio, recent message counts, and tool output limits. Enabled by default.
- **Automatic compaction in message history retrieval** (`opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`): `_get_message_history()` now checks conversation size against model limits and injects a compaction summary as a system message when needed, transparent to the agent framework.
- **Persisted compaction bookmarks** (`opencontractserver/conversations/models.py`): Added `compaction_summary` and `compacted_before_message_id` fields to the `Conversation` model. Compaction is computed once and persisted — subsequent reads skip old messages at the DB level via `id__gt` filter, making long conversations cheap to load.
  - Migration: `opencontractserver/conversations/migrations/0015_add_compaction_fields.py`
  - `CoreConversationManager.persist_compaction()` writes the bookmark with optimistic locking (concurrent requests are safely resolved)
  - `CoreConversationManager.get_conversation_messages()` honours the cutoff automatically
- **Comprehensive test suite** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_context_guardrails.py`): 30+ unit tests covering token estimation, model lookup, truncation, compaction triggers, summary generation, message proxy conversion, configuration defaults, and Conversation model field definitions. Uses `SimpleTestCase` for fast parallel execution.

### Changed

#### Pipeline Registry: Deduplicate and Filter Abstract Components

- **Removed `MultimodalMicroserviceEmbedder` backwards-compatibility alias**: The module-level alias `MultimodalMicroserviceEmbedder = CLIPMicroserviceEmbedder` in `opencontractserver/pipeline/embedders/multimodal_microservice.py` has been removed. Use `CLIPMicroserviceEmbedder` directly.
- **Fixed duplicate embedder entries in pipeline registry**: `_discover_subclasses()` in `opencontractserver/pipeline/registry.py` now deduplicates discovered classes by identity and skips abstract intermediate base classes via `inspect.isabstract()`, preventing aliases and abstract bases from appearing in the get-embedders query endpoint.

### Fixed

#### Prompt Injection via User-Controlled Content in Agent Prompts

- **Root cause**: Thread and document action prompt builders injected user-controlled content (message bodies, thread titles, document titles) directly into Markdown-structured LLM prompts without any sanitisation boundary. A user who can post a message to a moderated thread could craft content that overrides agent instructions.
  - File: `opencontractserver/tasks/agent_tasks.py` (lines 808-848)
  - File: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/core_agents.py` (lines 963-983, 1036-1054)
  - File: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py` (lines 1655-1669, 2301-2315)
- **Fix**: All user-generated content injected into agent prompts is now wrapped in `<user_content>` / `</user_content>` XML fence tags. An explicit `UNTRUSTED_CONTENT_NOTICE` instruction block is added to thread moderation prompts telling the LLM to treat fenced content as raw data and ignore any embedded directives. A size-threshold warning (`UNTRUSTED_CONTENT_SIZE_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 1000 chars`) logs a `[PromptInjection]` warning for abnormally large user content.
  - New file: `opencontractserver/utils/prompt_sanitization.py` — `fence_user_content()`, `warn_if_content_large()`, `UNTRUSTED_CONTENT_NOTICE`
  - New constant: `opencontractserver/constants/moderation.py` — `UNTRUSTED_CONTENT_SIZE_WARNING_THRESHOLD`
  - New tests: `opencontractserver/tests/test_prompt_sanitization.py`
  - Updated tests: `opencontractserver/tests/test_thread_corpus_actions.py` — added `test_async_thread_action_prompt_fences_user_content`

#### Prompt Injection Mitigation Follow-up (Closes #913)

- **Dead code fix**: `warn_if_content_large()` was called on truncated message previews (max 203 chars) but checks against a 1000-char threshold, making the warning ineffective. Moved the call to run on full content before truncation.
  - File: `opencontractserver/tasks/agent_tasks.py` (`_build_thread_action_system_prompt`)
- **Inconsistent monitoring**: Document and corpus titles embedded in system prompts in `core_agents.py` and `pydantic_ai_agents.py` now have `warn_if_content_large()` calls for consistent size monitoring.
  - File: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/core_agents.py` (`CoreDocumentAgentFactory`, `CoreCorpusAgentFactory`)
  - File: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py` (`PydanticAIDocumentAgent`, `PydanticAICorpusAgent`)
- **Null safety**: All title values passed to `fence_user_content()` and `warn_if_content_large()` now use `or "untitled"` fallback to prevent `TypeError` when `document.title` or `corpus.title` is `None`.
  - Affected files: `agent_tasks.py`, `core_agents.py`, `pydantic_ai_agents.py`
- **Documentation mismatch**: `UNTRUSTED_CONTENT_NOTICE` now describes the labeled tag variant (`<user_content label="...">`) matching the actual implementation, and explains that the label attribute does not change handling.
  - File: `opencontractserver/utils/prompt_sanitization.py`

#### Frontend: Most views show legacy corpus.description instead of versioned mdDescription (Closes #892)

- **Backend description sync**: `Corpus.update_description()` now keeps the plain-text `description` field in sync when `md_description` is updated via the versioned markdown system. A new `_markdown_to_plain_text()` static method strips markdown formatting for the plain-text field.
  - File: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py` (lines 249-272, `update_description` method)
- **New `useCorpusMdDescription` hook**: Reusable React hook that fetches markdown content from a corpus's `mdDescription` URL and returns the raw text for rendering with `SafeMarkdown`.
  - File: `frontend/src/hooks/useCorpusMdDescription.ts`
- **CorpusContextSidebar**: Now fetches and renders the versioned markdown description instead of the stale plain-text `description` field.
  - File: `frontend/src/components/threads/CorpusContextSidebar.tsx`
- **DocumentKnowledgeBase**: Corpus info display now fetches `mdDescription` content and renders it as markdown. Added `title`, `description`, and `mdDescription` fields to the `GET_DOCUMENT_KNOWLEDGE_AND_ANNOTATIONS` query's corpus selection.
  - File: `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/DocumentKnowledgeBase.tsx`
  - File: `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts` (line 3028)
- **CorpusHeader (settings)**: Now fetches and renders the versioned markdown description via `useCorpusMdDescription` hook with `SafeMarkdown`. Added `mdDescription` to prop chain through `CorpusSettings` and `Corpuses.tsx`.
  - File: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/settings/CorpusHeader.tsx`
  - File: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusSettings.tsx`
  - File: `frontend/src/views/Corpuses.tsx`
- **TypeScript type update**: Added `mdDescription` optional field to `RawCorpusType`.
  - File: `frontend/src/types/graphql-api.ts`

#### Edit Description Modal Does Not Save on Update (Issue #899)

- **Root cause**: The edit document CRUDModal in `App.tsx` had a no-op `onSubmit` handler that only closed the modal without calling the `UPDATE_DOCUMENT` mutation, so changes were silently discarded
  - File: `frontend/src/App.tsx` (lines 128-149, 398)
- **Fix**: Added `useMutation` hook for `UPDATE_DOCUMENT` in `App.tsx` with proper `onCompleted`/`onError` handlers and `refetchQueries: "active"` to refresh displayed data
- **Removed duplicate modals**: `Documents.tsx` rendered its own edit/view CRUDModals controlled by the same `editingDocument` reactive var as `App.tsx`, causing potential double-modal rendering. Removed the duplicates from `Documents.tsx` and consolidated into the global `App.tsx` handler
  - File: `frontend/src/views/Documents.tsx` (removed ~45 lines of duplicate modal + mutation code)

### Changed

#### Import/Export Pipeline Consolidation

- **DRY refactor of import/export code**: Extracted shared helpers into `opencontractserver/utils/importing.py`:
  - `prepare_import_labels()` - eliminates 4x duplicated label loading boilerplate
  - `create_document_from_export_data()` - eliminates 3x duplicated document creation
  - `import_doc_annotations()` - eliminates 3x duplicated doc+text annotation import loops
- **V1 import now delegates to V2 machinery**: `import_corpus()` in `import_tasks.py` delegates to `import_corpus_v2()` which handles both V1 and V2 formats through a unified `_import_corpus()` handler
- **V2 import fixed to use `corpus.add_document()`**: Previously created documents directly without corpus isolation; now properly uses the versioning API for correct DocumentPath records and corpus isolation
- **V2 import now sets permissions on annotations**: Previously skipped `set_permissions_for_obj_to_user` on annotations
- **V2 import now handles `content_modalities`**: Via the shared `import_annotations()` helper
- **Export finalization DRYed up**: New `finalize_export()` in `export_tasks.py` replaces 4x repeated save/timestamp/notification pattern in `package_annotated_docs`, `package_funsd_exports`, `on_demand_post_processors`, and `package_corpus_export_v2`
- **Removed duplicate `import_relationships` and `import_document_paths`** from `utils/import_v2.py` - relationship import handled inline in `_import_v2_relationships`, DocumentPaths created by `corpus.add_document()`
- **Deleted empty `opencontractserver/utils/export.py`**

### Added

#### Store Model Name in ChatMessage Metadata (#897)

- **Automatic model name persistence**: The LLM model name from `AgentConfig` is now stored in the `data` JSON field of every `ChatMessage` produced by an agent, enabling debugging, auditing, and reproducibility
  - `opencontractserver/llms/agents/core_agents.py` — all five `CoreConversationManager` message-writing methods now persist `data["model_name"]`:
    - `create_placeholder_message()` and `store_llm_message()` — unconditional write at creation time
    - `complete_message()`, `update_message()`, `mark_message_error()` — use `setdefault` to backfill without overwriting placeholder values
- **Tests**: Seven new async tests verifying model name storage across all message lifecycle paths
  - `opencontractserver/tests/test_core_agents.py` — covers explicit model name, default model name, all five methods, and `setdefault` preservation semantics

#### Nested Approval Gates for Corpus Agent Sub-Agents

- **Sub-agent approval propagation**: When a corpus agent delegates a question to a document sub-agent via `ask_document`, and the sub-agent encounters a tool requiring approval, the approval request now propagates up to the corpus agent level and is surfaced to the user via WebSocket (`ASYNC_APPROVAL_NEEDED`)
  - File: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py` (ask_document_tool closure)
- **Frontend sub-tool unwrapping**: CorpusChat's approval modal now displays the actual sub-tool name/arguments instead of the generic `ask_document` wrapper, with validation for malformed metadata
  - File: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusChat.tsx` (ASYNC_APPROVAL_NEEDED handler)
- **Comprehensive nested approval test suite**: 10 async tests covering approval propagation, metadata stripping, bypass flag lifecycle, malformed event handling, and schema safety
  - File: `opencontractserver/tests/test_nested_approval_gates.py`
- **Architecture documentation**: Added "Nested Approval Gates" section to LLM framework docs with flow diagrams and security notes
  - File: `docs/architecture/llms/README.md`

#### Expose Tool Usage in Chat UI

- **Tool Usage Badge** (`frontend/src/components/widgets/chat/ChatMessage.tsx:1180-1288`): Assistant messages that use tools now display a wrench icon badge ("X tools used") in the message header, visible in both document and corpus chat views. Users can quickly see AI tool usage without expanding the full timeline, improving agent transparency.
- **Tool Call Popover** (`ChatMessage.tsx:1222-1286`): Hovering over the badge opens a popover listing each tool call's formatted name, JSON input arguments, and output result. Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space to toggle, Escape to close) with full ARIA attributes.
- **Tool result content in timeline**: Backend now captures tool result/output content in timeline `tool_result` entries (previously only stored tool name)
  - `opencontractserver/llms/agents/timeline_schema.py:52` — added `result` field
  - `opencontractserver/llms/agents/timeline_utils.py:77-92` — captures result from metadata, truncated to 500 chars
  - `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py:123-155` — `_extract_tool_result_summary()` extracts and truncates at source
- **Tool result entries for search tools** (`pydantic_ai_agents.py:642-657, 686-702, 807-813`): `similarity_search`, `search_exact_text`, and `ask_document` now emit `tool_result` timeline entries with result summaries (e.g., "Found 3 matching annotations"). Other tools use a generic extractor with "Completed" fallback.

#### Automated Documentation Screenshots

- **Screenshot capture utility** (`frontend/tests/utils/docScreenshot.ts`): Captures screenshots during Playwright component tests using an enforced `{area}--{component}--{state}` naming convention
- **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/screenshots.yml`): Automatically runs component tests on PRs touching `frontend/` or `docs/`, then commits updated screenshots back to the PR branch
- **Initial screenshot coverage**: Landing page components (hero, stats bar, trending corpuses, call-to-action) and badge components (celebration modal, toast)

#### V2 Export Format

- **`OPEN_CONTRACTS_V2` export format**: New export type available in `StartCorpusExport` mutation that includes structural annotation sets, folder hierarchy, relationships, agent config, markdown descriptions, and conversations
- **`content_modalities` now exported**: Annotations with IMAGE or other modalities now survive export/import round-trips (`opencontractserver/utils/etl.py:build_document_export`)
- **Migration `0025_alter_userexport_format_add_v2`**: Adds `OPEN_CONTRACTS_V2` to UserExport format choices

#### Edge Case Tests for Personal Corpus (Issue #839)

- **Concurrent creation race condition test**: Verifies that 5 concurrent threads calling `get_or_create_personal_corpus()` all return the same corpus with no duplicates or errors
  - File: `opencontractserver/tests/test_personal_corpus.py` (`TestConcurrentPersonalCorpusCreation`)
- **Delete and recreate flow tests**: Verifies that after deleting a personal corpus, recreation produces a new corpus with correct attributes and permissions
  - File: `opencontractserver/tests/test_personal_corpus.py` (`TestDeleteAndRecreatePersonalCorpus`)
- **Embedding task queue failure tests**: Verifies graceful degradation when Redis/Celery is unavailable during embedding task queuing, including partial batch failure scenarios
  - File: `opencontractserver/tests/test_personal_corpus.py` (`TestEmbeddingTaskQueueFailure`)

### Fixed

#### MCP Telemetry in Async Context

- **`SynchronousOnlyOperation` in MCP server** (`config/telemetry.py`, `opencontractserver/mcp/telemetry.py`, `opencontractserver/mcp/server.py`): Added async telemetry functions (`arecord_event`, `arecord_mcp_tool_call`, `arecord_mcp_resource_read`, `arecord_mcp_request`) that use `sync_to_async` to safely run Django ORM lookups in a thread pool. Prevents "You cannot call this from an async context" errors on every MCP request.
- **Installation ID caching** (`config/telemetry.py:91-113`): Added process-lifetime cache for installation UUID to eliminate redundant database queries on every telemetry call, particularly beneficial for high-frequency MCP requests.

#### Security: LLM Prompt Injection Protection for Approval Bypass

- **Replaced `skip_approval` function parameter with `config._approval_bypass_allowed` flag**: The previous design exposed a `skip_approval` parameter in `ask_document_tool`'s function signature that a malicious LLM could set to `True` to bypass approval gates. Now uses a runtime flag on `AgentConfig` that only `resume_with_approval()` can set, wrapped in a `try/finally` block to guarantee reset
  - File: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`

#### Inconsistent Approval Status Handling in CorpusChat

- **Added `updateMessageApprovalStatus` to CorpusChat**: Previously, `ASYNC_APPROVAL_RESULT` handler in CorpusChat only cleared pending state without updating message `approvalStatus`, unlike ChatTray and useAgentChat which both call `updateMessageApprovalStatus`. Now consistent across all components
  - File: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusChat.tsx`
- **Added message `approvalStatus: "awaiting"` on ASYNC_APPROVAL_NEEDED**: CorpusChat now marks messages as awaiting approval in both `chat` and `serverMessages` state arrays, matching ChatTray/useAgentChat behavior
  - File: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusChat.tsx`

#### Defensive Handling of Malformed Approval Events

- **Backend**: `ask_document_tool` now validates `pending_tool_call` is a dict with a non-empty `name` key before raising `ToolConfirmationRequired`; malformed events are logged and skipped
  - File: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py`
- **Frontend**: `_sub_tool_name` validation checks type is string and non-empty; `_sub_tool_arguments` validates type is object before use
  - File: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusChat.tsx`

#### Corpus Agent Action Failure: griffe/pydantic-ai Incompatibility

- **Pin `griffe>=1.3.2,<2`** (`requirements/base.txt`): griffe 2.0.0 (released 2026-02-09) removed the `**options` catch-all from all docstring parsers. pydantic-ai 0.2.x unconditionally passes `returns_named_value` and `returns_multiple_items` as parser options to all parsers (including numpy), causing `TypeError: parse_numpy() got an unexpected keyword argument 'returns_named_value'`. This broke all `run_agent_corpus_action` tasks during agent creation. Pinning griffe below 2.0 restores the `**options` parameter that absorbs these Google-specific options harmlessly.

#### SynchronousOnlyOperation in Vector Store Construction from Async Context

- **Wrap vector store construction in `sync_to_async`** (`opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/pydantic_ai_vector_stores.py:392`): `create_vector_search_tool()` now wraps `PydanticAIAnnotationVectorStore(...)` in `sync_to_async` so the sync ORM calls inside `CoreAnnotationVectorStore.__init__` (embedder resolution via `get_embedder()`) run in a thread pool instead of triggering Django's `SynchronousOnlyOperation`.
- **Pre-resolve embedder_path in `PydanticAIDocumentAgent.create()`** (`opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py:1529`): Added async embedder pre-resolution using `aget_embedder()` before constructing the vector store, matching the existing pattern in `PydanticAICorpusAgent.create()`. This prevents the sync `get_embedder()` fallback from hitting the ORM in an async context.
- **Defensive `sync_to_async` fallback in both agent `create()` methods** (`pydantic_ai_agents.py`): If `aget_embedder()` fails and `embedder_path` remains `None`, the `PydanticAIAnnotationVectorStore(...)` constructor is wrapped in `sync_to_async` so the ORM calls inside `get_embedder()` run in a thread pool. Applied to both `PydanticAIDocumentAgent.create()` and `PydanticAICorpusAgent.create()`.
- **Fix async test** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_pydantic_ai_agents.py:412`): Wrapped `PydanticAIAnnotationVectorStore(...)` construction in `sync_to_async` in `test_pydantic_ai_vector_store_search`.

### Changed

#### Streamlined Agentic Corpus Action Configuration

- **Renamed `agent_prompt` to `task_instructions`** on `CorpusAction` model (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`): Single, clearly-named field for describing what the agent should do. Migration `0041` handles the rename.
- **Goal-oriented system prompt assembly** (`opencontractserver/tasks/agent_tasks.py`): Agent corpus actions now auto-generate a structured system prompt with automation guardrails ("you MUST use tools"), execution context (trigger type, document metadata, corpus info), and the user's task instructions. Agents no longer receive raw `system_instructions` as the system prompt — the system wraps everything in a goal-oriented format that prevents conversational responses.
- **Document context injection**: Document-based agent actions now inject document title, ID, corpus title, and current description into the system prompt so agents don't waste tool calls loading basic metadata.
- **Thread context injection refactored**: Thread-based agent actions now use the same structured prompt pattern as document actions, with thread context, recent messages, and triggering message content all included in the system prompt rather than the user message.
- **`AgentConfiguration` is now optional for agent actions**: `CorpusAction` can be created with just `task_instructions` (no `agent_config` required). The DB constraint (`valid_action_type_configuration`) now allows lightweight agent actions. `AgentConfiguration` is still supported for custom persona/tool defaults.
- **Default tool selection by trigger type** (`opencontractserver/constants/corpus_actions.py`): When no tools are specified on `agent_config.available_tools`, the system auto-selects trigger-appropriate defaults (document tools for add/edit triggers, moderation tools for thread/message triggers).
- **`pre_authorized_tools` semantics changed** (`opencontractserver/tasks/agent_tasks.py`): `pre_authorized_tools` now only controls which tools skip approval gates. Tool availability is determined by `agent_config.available_tools` (if set) or trigger-appropriate defaults. See **Breaking Changes** below for migration guidance.
- **GraphQL API updated**: `CreateCorpusAction` and `UpdateCorpusAction` mutations use `taskInstructions` instead of `agentPrompt`. The `taskInstructions` field alone (without `agentConfigId`) is now sufficient to create an agent action.
- **Frontend updated**: `CreateCorpusActionModal` and `CorpusActionsSection` use "Task Instructions" labeling instead of "Agent Prompt".
- **Unified Quick Create flow**: `CreateCorpusActionModal` now supports inline agent creation for document triggers (add_document, edit_document) in addition to thread triggers. The modal auto-selects trigger-appropriate tools and default instructions.
- **Manual action trigger** (`config/graphql/mutations.py`): New `RunCorpusAction` mutation allows superusers to manually trigger agent actions on specific documents. Uses `transaction.on_commit()` to dispatch Celery tasks after the DB transaction commits, and `force=True` to bypass dedup checks for manual triggers.
- **ToolFunctionRegistry** (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_registry.py`): Centralized singleton registry mapping tool names to sync/async function implementations. Replaces 3 manually-curated dicts in `_resolve_tools()`. Adding a new tool now requires edits in 2 files instead of 4+.

#### Mobile Navigation & URL-Driven Corpus Navigation

- **Detail view switching now pushes browser history**: `updateDetailViewParam()` in `frontend/src/utils/navigationUtils.ts` now pushes new history entries instead of replacing, so browser back/forward navigates between landing and details views. `updateTabParam()` retains replace semantics so tab switches don't accumulate history entries
- **Thread selection now URL-driven**: Discussions tab thread selection uses the existing `?thread=` query parameter (synced by CentralRouteManager) instead of the local `inlineSelectedThreadIdAtom` Jotai atom. Clicking a thread pushes `?thread=<id>` to the URL; browser back returns to the list
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/discussions/CorpusDiscussionsView.tsx`, `frontend/src/utils/navigationUtils.ts`, `frontend/src/views/Corpuses.tsx`
- **Tab-specific params cleared on tab switch**: `updateTabParam()` now removes `thread` and `message` params when switching tabs to prevent stale state persisting across tab changes
- **Removed `inlineSelectedThreadIdAtom`**: Replaced by URL-driven `selectedThreadId` reactive var from `frontend/src/graphql/cache.ts`; dead `onViewModeChange` callback removed from `CorpusDiscussionsView`

### Added

#### Mobile Menu Access in Corpus Home Views

- **Mobile navigation menu buttons**: Added `MobileMenuButton` (kebab icon, visible ≤600px) to `CorpusLandingView` (breadcrumb row) and `CorpusDetailsView` (header row), allowing mobile users to open the sidebar bottom sheet from the home tab — previously only accessible from non-home tabs
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome/CorpusLandingView.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome/CorpusDetailsView.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome/styles.ts`
- **`updateThreadParam()` utility**: New navigation utility for setting/clearing the `?thread=` URL param with push semantics, following the same pattern as `updateTabParam()` and `updateMessageParam()`
  - File: `frontend/src/utils/navigationUtils.ts`

### Breaking Changes

- **`pre_authorized_tools` no longer controls tool availability**: Previously, `pre_authorized_tools` was used as both the tool set AND the approval gate — if set, it replaced `agent_config.available_tools` entirely. Now it only controls which tools skip the approval gate. **Migration**: If you relied on `pre_authorized_tools` to restrict which tools an agent can access, move those tool names to `agent_config.available_tools` instead. `pre_authorized_tools` should only list tools that are safe to run without human approval.

### Known Limitations

- **Orphaned QUEUED executions if Celery broker is unavailable**: The `RunCorpusAction` mutation creates a `CorpusActionExecution` with `QUEUED` status and dispatches the Celery task via `transaction.on_commit()`. If the Celery broker is down at commit time, the task dispatch silently fails and the execution record stays `QUEUED` indefinitely. This is a general characteristic of the `on_commit` + Celery pattern used throughout the codebase. Monitor for stale `QUEUED` records if broker reliability is a concern.

#### Edge Case Tests for Personal Corpus (Issue #839)

- **Concurrent creation race condition test**: Verifies that 5 concurrent threads calling `get_or_create_personal_corpus()` all return the same corpus with no duplicates or errors
  - File: `opencontractserver/tests/test_personal_corpus.py` (`TestConcurrentPersonalCorpusCreation`)
- **Delete and recreate flow tests**: Verifies that after deleting a personal corpus, recreation produces a new corpus with correct attributes and permissions
  - File: `opencontractserver/tests/test_personal_corpus.py` (`TestDeleteAndRecreatePersonalCorpus`)
- **Embedding task queue failure tests**: Verifies graceful degradation when Redis/Celery is unavailable during embedding task queuing, including partial batch failure scenarios
  - File: `opencontractserver/tests/test_personal_corpus.py` (`TestEmbeddingTaskQueueFailure`)

### Fixed

#### Security Hardening: Authentication & Permissioning Audit Remediation

- **Analysis callback DoS prevention** (`opencontractserver/analyzer/views.py`): Invalid callback tokens no longer mark analyses as FAILED; uses `hmac.compare_digest()` for timing-safe token comparison; unified error messages prevent analysis ID enumeration
- **User lock logic inversion** (`config/graphql/base.py`): Fixed `==` to `!=` in DRFDeletion and DRFMutation user lock checks — previously blocked the lock holder and allowed everyone else
- **IDOR prevention in base mutations** (`config/graphql/base.py`): DRFDeletion and DRFMutation now use `visible_to_user()` filtering before `.get()` to prevent object existence leakage
- **Open redirect prevention** (`config/urls.py`): `home_redirect` now validates the Host header against `ALLOWED_HOSTS` before constructing the redirect URL
- **Cross-corpus data leakage** (`config/graphql/graphene_types.py`): Document summary resolvers (`resolve_summary_revisions`, `resolve_current_summary_version`, `resolve_summary_content`) now verify corpus visibility before returning data
- **CSRF trusted origins** (`config/settings/production.py`): Fixed missing comma causing implicit string concatenation in `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
- **HSTS enforcement** (`config/settings/production.py`): Increased `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` from 60 to 518400 (6 days)
- **Analyzer visibility default** (`opencontractserver/analyzer/models.py`): Changed `Analyzer` and `GremlinEngine` `is_public` default from `True` to `False` to prevent accidental data exposure
- **IDOR prevention in GraphQL mutations** (`config/graphql/mutations.py`): Added `visible_to_user()` filtering to 11 previously unprotected `.objects.get()` calls in `StartDocumentExtract`, `DeleteAnalysisMutation`, `CreateColumn`, `CreateExtract`, `CreateCorpusAction`, `UpdateCorpusAction`, and `CreateNote`
- **IDOR prevention in conversation mutations** (`config/graphql/conversation_mutations.py`): `CreateThreadMutation` and `CreateThreadMessageMutation` now use `visible_to_user()` instead of fetch-then-check pattern
- **IDOR prevention in folder mutations** (`config/graphql/corpus_folder_mutations.py`): All folder mutations now verify corpus visibility before operating on folders; folder lookups scoped to validated corpus
- **IDOR prevention in voting mutations** (`config/graphql/voting_mutations.py`): `VoteMessageMutation` and `RemoveVoteMutation` now use `ChatMessage.objects.visible_to_user()` instead of fetch-then-check
- **IDOR prevention in badge mutations** (`config/graphql/badge_mutations.py`): `AwardBadgeMutation` now uses `Badge.objects.visible_to_user()` for badge lookup

### Fixed

#### Enable Relationships for Span-Based (Text) Annotations (Closes #281)

- **File type detection inconsistency**: Multiple frontend components checked for text file types using only `startsWith("text/")`, missing documents with `application/txt` MIME type. Created centralized `isTextFileType()` and `isPdfFileType()` utilities in `frontend/src/utils/files.ts` and updated all callers.
- **Label initialization race condition**: The `initialized.current` ref in `UISettingsAtom.tsx` (line 288) could be set to `true` after span label initialization, preventing relationship labels from auto-initializing on subsequent effect runs. Replaced with separate `spanLabelInitialized` and `relationLabelInitialized` refs.
- **Type restrictions blocking span annotations in relationship UI**: `RelationItem`, `RelationHighlightItem`, `HighlightItem`, and `annotationSelectedViaRelationship()` only accepted `ServerTokenAnnotation` (PDF annotations). Updated all to accept `ServerTokenAnnotation | ServerSpanAnnotation` union type, enabling the sidebar relationship display and creation flow for text documents.
- **Files changed**: `frontend/src/utils/files.ts`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/context/UISettingsAtom.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/sidebar/RelationItem.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/sidebar/RelationHighlightItem.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/sidebar/HighlightItem.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/utils.ts`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/hooks/AnnotationHooks.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/labels/EnhancedLabelSelector.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/labels/UnifiedLabelSelector.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotator/labels/label_selector/LabelSelector.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/DocumentKnowledgeBase.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/widgets/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`

## [3.0.0.b4] - 2026-02-08

### ⚠️ Important Migration Notes

**Migration 0040 (`corpus_created_with_embedder`) backfills existing corpuses**

This release includes a data migration that:

- Adds a `created_with_embedder` audit field to all corpuses
- Backfills `preferred_embedder` on existing corpuses that don't have one set (uses current `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER`)
- Backfills `created_with_embedder` from `preferred_embedder`

This migration is safe and non-destructive. Existing corpuses with explicit `preferred_embedder` values are unchanged.

**Migration 0038 (`create_personal_corpuses`) is IRREVERSIBLE**

This release includes a data migration that creates personal "My Documents" corpuses for all users and moves standalone documents into them. This migration **cannot be rolled back** via `python manage.py migrate`. Attempting to reverse will raise `NotImplementedError`.

**Before deploying to production:**

- Ensure you have a database backup
- Test the migration in a staging environment first
- Plan for this being a one-way migration

If rollback is required after deployment, you must write a custom migration to handle your specific data preservation needs.

### Added

#### Document Processing Failure Indicators and Retry Controls (Issue #825)

- **Processing status display**: Document cards and list items now show distinct states for processing (spinner) vs. failed (error overlay with message) instead of a generic "Processing..." overlay for all locked documents
- **Retry button**: Failed documents display a retry button that triggers the `RetryDocumentProcessing` GraphQL mutation, allowing users to re-process documents without backend access
- **Context menu retry**: "Retry Processing" option added to the document context menu for failed documents
- **Permission-aware**: Retry controls only appear when the user has permission to retry (`canRetry` field from backend)
- **Error messages**: Processing error messages from the backend are displayed on the failure overlay (truncated for readability)
- Files: `frontend/src/components/documents/ModernDocumentItem.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/documents/DocumentItem.tsx`, `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`, `frontend/src/graphql/mutations.ts`, `frontend/src/types/graphql-api.ts`

#### Embedder Consistency Management (Issue #437)

- **Frozen embedder binding at corpus creation**: `preferred_embedder` is now auto-populated from `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER` when a corpus is created without an explicit embedder. This decouples existing corpuses from future changes to the global setting.
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py` (save method)
- **Audit trail field `created_with_embedder`**: Records which embedder was active at corpus creation. Never changes, even after re-embedding.
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`, migration `0040_corpus_created_with_embedder.py`
- **Immutability guard on `preferred_embedder`**: `UpdateCorpusMutation` rejects changes to `preferred_embedder` after documents have been added to a corpus, preventing inconsistent embeddings.
  - Files: `config/graphql/mutations.py` (UpdateCorpusMutation.mutate)
- **`reEmbedCorpus` mutation**: Controlled migration path for changing a corpus's embedder. Locks the corpus, queues background re-embedding for all annotations, and unlocks when complete.
  - Files: `config/graphql/mutations.py` (ReEmbedCorpus), `opencontractserver/tasks/corpus_tasks.py` (reembed_corpus)
- **Fork with embedder override**: `forkCorpus` mutation now accepts optional `preferredEmbedder` argument to create the fork with a different embedder.
  - Files: `config/graphql/mutations.py` (StartCorpusFork)
- **Corpus-scoped search uses corpus embedder**: `resolve_semantic_search` now uses `corpus.preferred_embedder` for corpus-scoped queries instead of the global `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER`, ensuring consistent results.
  - Files: `config/graphql/queries.py` (resolve_semantic_search)
- **Startup system check**: Django system check warns at startup if `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER` has changed since existing corpuses were created, preventing silent search inconsistencies.
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/checks.py`, `opencontractserver/corpuses/apps.py`

#### Auth0 Authentication for Django Admin

- **Auth0 admin login support**: Django admin now supports Auth0 authentication when `USE_AUTH0=True`
  - Custom login view displays Auth0 "Sign in" button with password fallback
  - Custom logout view properly clears both Django session and Auth0 session
  - Backward compatible: password authentication always available
  - Files: `config/admin_auth/views.py`, `config/admin_auth/backends.py`
- **Admin claims synchronization**: Admin privileges can be set via Auth0 token claims
  - Supports `{namespace}is_staff` and `{namespace}is_superuser` claims
  - Claims synced on API requests with 5-minute cache TTL (configurable via `ADMIN_CLAIMS_CACHE_TTL` constant)
  - Immediate sync during admin login ensures fresh permissions for admin access
  - Handles boolean, string ("true"/"false"), and numeric (0/1) claim values
  - Configurable namespace via `AUTH0_ADMIN_CLAIM_NAMESPACE` env var
  - Files: `config/graphql_auth0_auth/utils.py:269-360`
  - **Required Auth0 Action** (Post-Login): Set up the following Auth0 Action to include admin claims in tokens:

    ```javascript
    exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
      const namespace = "https://opencontracts.opensource.legal/";
      const appMetadata = event.user.app_metadata || {};

      // Add admin claims to access token
      if (appMetadata.is_staff !== undefined) {
        api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(
          `${namespace}is_staff`,
          appMetadata.is_staff,
        );
      }
      if (appMetadata.is_superuser !== undefined) {
        api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(
          `${namespace}is_superuser`,
          appMetadata.is_superuser,
        );
      }
    };
    ```

    Then set `app_metadata.is_staff` and `app_metadata.is_superuser` on users via Auth0 Management API or Dashboard.

- **Auth0AdminBackend**: Dedicated authentication backend for admin login via Auth0
  - Validates user exists, is active, and has `is_staff=True`
  - Files: `config/admin_auth/backends.py:18-88`
- **Security hardening**:
  - Open redirect prevention using `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme()`
  - Host header injection prevention for Auth0 logout `returnTo` URL
  - CSRF protection on all login/logout endpoints
  - Files: `config/admin_auth/views.py:24-89`
- **Professional login template**: Standalone HTML template with Auth0 SDK integration
  - Loading states, error handling, graceful degradation
  - Uses Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN-hosted Auth0 SDK
  - **CSP Note**: Template uses inline JavaScript; if Content-Security-Policy is enabled,
    add `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` or implement CSP nonces
  - Files: `opencontractserver/templates/admin/auth0_login.html`
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: 50+ tests covering security edge cases
  - Open redirect prevention, boolean claim parsing, logout URL safety
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_admin_auth.py`

### Fixed

- **Admin token handling**: Admin login no longer accepts JWT tokens via query parameters (reduces CSRF/token leakage risk). Files: `config/admin_auth/views.py:146-179`
- **Admin claims demotion**: Missing or invalid admin claims now default to False to avoid privilege retention. Files: `config/graphql_auth0_auth/utils.py:331-411`
- **Token storage scope**: Admin Auth0 SPA client now uses in-memory token storage instead of localStorage. Files: `opencontractserver/templates/admin/auth0_login.html:249-257`

#### Runtime-Configurable Pipeline Settings (Superuser Only)

- **PipelineSettings singleton model**: Database-backed configuration for document processing pipeline
  - Stores preferred parsers, embedders, and thumbnailers per MIME type
  - Stores parser-specific kwargs and component settings overrides
  - Database is the single source of truth at runtime (no Django settings fallback)
  - Singleton pattern: only one instance exists, cannot be deleted
  - Files: `opencontractserver/documents/models.py:734-1140`
- **Encrypted secrets storage**: Secure storage for API keys and sensitive credentials
  - Uses Fernet symmetric encryption (key derived from Django SECRET_KEY)
  - Secrets are never exposed via GraphQL responses
  - GraphQL only returns list of components that have secrets configured
  - Methods: `set_secrets()`, `get_secrets()`, `update_secrets()`, `get_full_component_settings()`
  - Files: `opencontractserver/documents/models.py:1012-1139`
- **GraphQL query `pipelineSettings`**: Any authenticated user can read current pipeline configuration
  - Returns preferred components, parser kwargs, component settings
  - Includes `componentsWithSecrets` field (list of paths, not actual secrets)
  - Includes audit fields (modified, modified_by)
  - Files: `config/graphql/queries.py:4214-4250`
- **GraphQL mutation `updatePipelineSettings`**: Superusers can modify pipeline configuration at runtime
  - Validates component class paths exist in the pipeline registry
  - Tracks who made changes (modified_by field)
  - Changes take effect immediately for new document processing tasks
  - Files: `config/graphql/pipeline_settings_mutations.py:20-220`
- **GraphQL mutation `resetPipelineSettings`**: Superusers can reset to Django settings defaults
  - Restores all values from PREFERRED_PARSERS, PREFERRED_EMBEDDERS, etc.
  - Files: `config/graphql/pipeline_settings_mutations.py:223-302`
- **GraphQL mutation `updateComponentSecrets`**: Superusers can securely store API keys per component
  - Accepts component path and secrets dict, encrypts and stores in database
  - Supports merge mode (add to existing) or replace mode
  - Files: `config/graphql/pipeline_settings_mutations.py:305-411`
- **GraphQL mutation `deleteComponentSecrets`**: Superusers can remove secrets for a component
  - Files: `config/graphql/pipeline_settings_mutations.py:414-481`
- **Migration 0031**: Creates PipelineSettings table with encrypted_secrets field
  - Files: `opencontractserver/documents/migrations/0031_add_pipeline_settings.py`
- **Migration 0032**: Adds database index to `PipelineSettings.modified` for audit query performance
  - Files: `opencontractserver/documents/migrations/0032_add_index_to_pipeline_settings_modified.py`
- **Management command `migrate_pipeline_settings`**: Self-documenting component discovery and settings migration
  - `--list-components`: Introspects pipeline registry to show all components with settings schemas, env vars, defaults, and descriptions
  - `--sync-preferences`: Syncs PREFERRED_PARSERS, PREFERRED_EMBEDDERS, etc. from Django settings to database
  - `--component <name>`: Filters output to a specific component
  - Files: `opencontractserver/documents/management/commands/migrate_pipeline_settings.py`
- **Pipeline Configuration Guide**: Documentation covering first-time setup, upgrades, runtime configuration, and troubleshooting
  - Files: `docs/pipelines/pipeline_configuration.md`
- **Integration with doc_tasks**: `ingest_doc` and `extract_thumbnail` now read from PipelineSettings
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/doc_tasks.py:355-374`, `opencontractserver/tasks/doc_tasks.py:686-721`
- **Integration with pipeline/utils**: `get_preferred_embedder` and `get_default_embedder` use PipelineSettings
  - Files: `opencontractserver/pipeline/utils.py:303-361`

### Changed

- Pipeline settings getters (`get_preferred_parser`, `get_preferred_embedder`, `get_parser_kwargs`, `get_default_embedder`) no longer fall back to Django settings at runtime. Database is the sole source of truth; initial values are populated from Django settings via `get_instance()`.
  - Files: `opencontractserver/documents/models.py:977-1092`
- Pipeline component settings are now DB-only at runtime (Django settings fallback removed from `PipelineComponentBase.get_component_settings()`)
  - Files: `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/base_component.py:180-217`
- Pipeline configuration UI now reads component settings schema from GraphQL instead of hardcoding config requirements.
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx:69-129`
- Pipeline configuration UI now centralizes pipeline UI constants in `PIPELINE_UI` for sizing and validation values.
  - Files: `frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts:174-187`

### Fixed

- Secrets modal now validates component existence, required secret fields, and payload size before mutation.
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx:1500-1558`
- MIME filter accessibility labels now include stage context.
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx:1076-1089`
- GraphQL `updateComponentSecrets` mutation now validates payload size before encryption attempt.
  - Files: `config/graphql/pipeline_settings_mutations.py:104-135`
- Pipeline components query now requires authentication; non-superusers only see configured components without settings schema details.
  - Files: `config/graphql/queries.py:1815-1949`
- Settings schema `_coerce_value` now logs warnings on coercion failures instead of silently swallowing errors.
  - Files: `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/settings_schema.py:416-419`
- `PipelineSettings.save()` now invalidates cache via `transaction.on_commit()` to prevent stale cache when DB write rolls back.
  - Files: `opencontractserver/documents/models.py:896-906`
- `PipelineComponentCard` memo now uses custom comparison to avoid unnecessary re-renders from object prop references.
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx:1134-1140`
- Pipeline mutation error messages now consistently include component path for debugging.
  - Files: `config/graphql/pipeline_settings_mutations.py:644-656, 720-729`

### Removed

#### ModernBERT Embedders

- **⚠️ Breaking Change**: ModernBERT embedders have been removed from the codebase
  - `opencontractserver/pipeline/embedders/modern_bert_embedder.py` - removed
  - `opencontractserver/pipeline/embedders/minn_modern_bert_embedder.py` - removed
  - `model_preloaders/download_modernbert_model.py` - removed
  - Tests removed: `opencontractserver/tests/test_modern_bert_embedder.py`, `opencontractserver/tests/test_minn_modern_bert_embedder.py`
  - Documentation removed: `docs/embedders/modernbert_embedder.md`, `docs/embedders/minn_modernbert_embedder.md`
  - **Migration path**: Users currently using ModernBERT embedders must switch to alternative embedders:
    - `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` - General purpose sentence transformer embeddings
    - `OpenAIEmbedder` - OpenAI API-based embeddings (requires API key)
    - `VoyageAIEmbedder` - Voyage AI embeddings (requires API key)
  - Update PipelineSettings via admin UI or management command before upgrading

#### Personal Corpus ("My Documents") Feature

- **Personal corpus auto-creation**: Each user now automatically receives a personal "My Documents" corpus
  - Created via signal handler when user account is created
  - Uses database constraint to ensure one personal corpus per user (`one_personal_corpus_per_user`)
  - Personal corpus is private (`is_public=False`) and grants full permissions to owner
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:378-432`, `opencontractserver/users/signals.py:16-48`
- **All uploads default to personal corpus**: Documents without a specified corpus go to "My Documents"
  - Single file uploads via GraphQL now route to personal corpus
  - Zip file bulk uploads also default to personal corpus when no corpus specified
  - Files: `config/graphql/mutations.py:1807-1908`, `opencontractserver/tasks/import_tasks.py:514-585`
- **`Corpus.get_or_create_personal_corpus()` class method**: Idempotent method to get/create personal corpus
  - Thread-safe using `get_or_create` with atomic transaction
  - Grants full permissions on creation
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:390-432`
- **Data migration for existing users**: Migration creates personal corpuses for existing users and moves standalone documents
  - Creates "My Documents" corpus for all active users
  - Moves documents without any DocumentPath to their creator's personal corpus
  - **⚠️ IRREVERSIBLE MIGRATION**: This migration cannot be rolled back automatically. Attempting to reverse will raise `NotImplementedError`. Rolling back would delete DocumentPath records and orphan user documents from their corpus organization. If rollback is required, a custom migration must be written to handle data preservation.
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/migrations/0038_create_personal_corpuses.py`

#### Shared StructuralAnnotationSet

- **Reuse structural sets instead of duplicating**: `add_document()` now reuses the source document's structural set
  - Previously, adding a document to a corpus duplicated the entire StructuralAnnotationSet
  - Now shares the set, reducing storage and maintaining single source of truth
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:528-535`
- **Incremental embedding creation**: New Celery task checks for missing embeddings when document is added
  - `ensure_embeddings_for_corpus()` checks if embeddings exist for corpus's required embedders
  - Only queues embedding generation for annotations missing embeddings
  - Supports both DEFAULT_EMBEDDER and corpus's preferred_embedder
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/corpus_tasks.py:712-850`

#### Inline Thread View with Corpus Context Sidebar

- **Added inline thread viewing**: Users can now view thread details inline within the Discussions tab instead of navigating away
  - Click a thread to view details in-place with a "Back" button to return to the list
  - Thread state tracked via `inlineSelectedThreadIdAtom` Jotai atom
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/discussions/CorpusDiscussionsView.tsx`, `frontend/src/atoms/threadAtoms.ts`
- **Added corpus context sidebar**: Displays corpus context alongside thread details
  - About section with corpus description (markdown rendered)
  - Documents section with collapsible table of contents
  - Quick stats grid (documents, threads, annotations, comments)
  - Collapsible sections with smooth animations via Framer Motion
  - Responsive behavior: hidden < 1024px, collapsible 1024-1200px, always expanded > 1200px
  - Sidebar expanded state persisted to localStorage via `threadContextSidebarExpandedAtom`
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/threads/CorpusContextSidebar.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/threads/ThreadDetailWithContext.tsx`
  - New styled components: `frontend/src/components/threads/styles/contextSidebarStyles.ts`
- **Added modernized discussion thread UI**: Comprehensive redesign following OS-Legal-Style design system
  - Typography-first design: Serif headings (Georgia), sans-serif body (Inter)
  - Teal accent color scheme (#0f766e) for interactive elements
  - Improved message cards, vote buttons, badges, and metadata displays
  - Mobile-responsive with proper breakpoints
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/threads/styles/discussionStyles.ts` (950+ lines)
- **Added agent mention rendering**: Discussion messages render styled agent mentions with custom colors
  - Runtime validation of badge configuration from GenericScalar fields
  - Hex color validation with fallback to default agent color
  - Tooltip display for agent mentions
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/threads/MarkdownMessageRenderer.tsx`
- **Added component tests for new features**:
  - Mention badge rendering tests: `frontend/tests/MentionRendering.ct.tsx`
  - Compact vote button tests: `frontend/tests/VoteButtonsCompact.ct.tsx`

### Technical Details

- Added `is_personal` BooleanField to Corpus model with database constraint
- Added composite index on `(creator, is_personal)` for efficient lookups
- Schema migration: `opencontractserver/corpuses/migrations/0037_add_is_personal_corpus.py`
- Comprehensive test suite: `opencontractserver/tests/test_personal_corpus.py` (14 tests)

#### AnnotationsPanel Shared Component

- **Created `AnnotationsPanel` reusable component**: Extracts shared filtering/display logic from annotations views
  - Provides filter tabs for type (All/Doc/Text) and source (All/Human/Agent/Structural)
  - Includes SearchBox, grid display with ModernAnnotationCard, empty state, and pagination
  - Can be used by both standalone Annotations view and corpus annotations tab
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/annotations/AnnotationsPanel.tsx`
- **Added `AnnotationsPanel` unit tests**: Comprehensive tests for filters, search, grid, empty/loading states
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/annotations/__tests__/AnnotationsPanel.test.tsx`
- **Added semantic search to corpus annotations tab**: Search box now uses vector similarity search
  - Debounced search triggers semantic search as user types (500ms delay)
  - Displays similarity scores on annotation cards
  - Supports infinite scroll for semantic search results
  - Shows appropriate empty state and loading messages for search mode
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/annotations/CorpusAnnotationCards.tsx`
- **Fixed semantic search similarity score calculation**: Scores now correctly display as percentages
  - CosineDistance returns distance (0=identical), converted to similarity (1=identical)
  - Results are sorted by similarity (highest first) and scores display correctly (e.g., 85% for close matches)
  - Files: `opencontractserver/shared/mixins.py`
- **Created lightweight `GET_ANNOTATIONS_FOR_CARDS` query**: Fetches only fields needed for ModernAnnotationCard display
  - Excludes heavy fields: `tokensJsons`, `json`, `page`, and unnecessary nested objects
  - Reduces payload from ~340KB to ~30KB for 2130 annotations (estimated 90% reduction)
  - Files: `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`

### Fixed

#### Annotations Panel Scroll Issue

- **Fixed corpus annotations tab scroll behavior**: Restructured AnnotationsPanel to scroll only the cards grid
  - Container uses flex column layout with `overflow: hidden`
  - FiltersSection has `flex-shrink: 0` to stay fixed at top
  - AnnotationsListContainer has `flex: 1` and `overflow-y: auto` for card scrolling
  - Filters (search, type tabs, source tabs) stay visible while cards scroll below
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/annotations/AnnotationsPanel.tsx`

#### Annotations Query Missing Pagination

- **Added initial page limit to annotations queries**: Previously loaded all annotations at once
  - Added `limit` and `cursor` fields to `GetAnnotationsInputs` interface
  - Set initial page size to 20 annotations for both Annotations.tsx and CorpusAnnotationCards.tsx
  - Infinite scroll loads more as user scrolls down
  - Files: `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`, `frontend/src/views/Annotations.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotations/CorpusAnnotationCards.tsx`

#### Corpus Annotations Tab Source Filter

- **Fixed structural annotations not visible in corpus tab**: Annotations tab now shows filter controls even when empty
  - Added source filter (Human/Agent/Structural) to `CorpusAnnotationCards`
  - Source filter syncs to GraphQL query variables: "structural" → `structural: true`, "human" → `structural: false, analysis_Isnull: true`, "agent" → `structural: false, analysis_Isnull: false`
  - Users can now toggle to see structural annotations that were previously hidden
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/annotations/CorpusAnnotationCards.tsx`
- **Added missing `usesLabelFromLabelsetId` to GetAnnotationsInputs interface**: Interface was missing a field used by the query
  - Files: `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts:752`

### Changed

#### BREAKING: Removed Corpus.documents M2M Relationship (PR #840)

- **Removed `Corpus.documents` ManyToManyField**: DocumentPath is now the sole source of truth for corpus-document relationships
  - Migration `0039_remove_corpus_documents_m2m` validates no orphaned M2M entries before removal
  - All code paths now use `corpus.add_document()`, `corpus.remove_document()`, `corpus.get_documents()`, `corpus.document_count()`
  - GraphQL `CorpusType.documents` field now resolves via explicit DocumentPath-based resolver
  - Frontend queries updated to use `documentCount` field instead of `documents { totalCount }`
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`, `config/graphql/graphene_types.py`, `config/graphql/queries.py`
- **Removed deprecated Corpus methods**: `_create_text_document_internal()` and `create_text_document()` removed (use `import_content()` instead)
  - Removed deprecated `content` parameter from `add_document()` (use `import_content()` for content-based imports)
  - Files: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`
- **Removed `sync_m2m_to_documentpath` management command**: No longer needed after M2M removal
  - Files: `opencontractserver/documents/management/commands/sync_m2m_to_documentpath.py` (deleted)
- **Added request-level caching to DocumentPathType**: Visible corpus IDs now cached per-request to prevent N+1 queries
  - Follows same pattern as `ConversationQueryOptimizer` and `DocumentRelationshipQueryOptimizer`
  - Files: `config/graphql/graphene_types.py:620-636`
- **Fixed stale frontend GraphQL queries**: Two queries still referenced removed `documents { totalCount }` connection field
  - `GET_EDITABLE_CORPUSES` in `AddToCorpusModal.tsx` now uses `documentCount`
  - `GET_MY_CORPUSES` in `queries.ts` now uses `documentCount`
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/modals/AddToCorpusModal.tsx`, `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts`

#### Pipeline Configuration UI Redesign

- **Replaced JSON-based configuration with visual pipeline flow**: System Settings page redesigned for intuitive configuration
  - Visual pipeline stages: Document Upload → Parser → Thumbnailer → Embedder → Ready for Search
  - Clickable component cards replace JSON text editing
  - Per-stage MIME type selectors (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
  - Auto-expanding advanced settings for components requiring API keys
  - Collapsible advanced settings to reduce visual clutter
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx`
- **New component icon system**: Custom SVG icons for each pipeline component type
  - Docling, LlamaParse, ModernBERT, OpenAI, and more
  - Semantic icons that are visually distinctive
  - Generic fallback icon for unknown components
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/admin/PipelineIcons.tsx`
- **Added accessibility attributes**: ARIA support for screen readers
  - `aria-pressed` on MIME type and component selection buttons
  - `aria-expanded` on collapsible settings sections
  - `aria-label` on interactive elements
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemSettings.tsx`

#### Window Resize Performance

- **Added debounce to window resize handler**: Prevents excessive re-renders during window resize
  - 150ms debounce delay on resize events
  - Properly cleans up timeout on unmount
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/hooks/WindowDimensionHook.tsx`

#### Annotations View Refactoring

- **Updated Annotations.tsx to use AnnotationsPanel**: DRY refactoring, keeps hero section, stats, semantic search, advanced filters
  - Files: `frontend/src/views/Annotations.tsx`
- **Deleted superseded AnnotationCards.tsx**: Functionality absorbed into AnnotationsPanel
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/annotations/AnnotationCards.tsx` (deleted)

#### Annotations Query Optimization

- **Switched to lightweight query for annotation cards**: Both `Annotations.tsx` and `CorpusAnnotationCards.tsx` now use `GET_ANNOTATIONS_FOR_CARDS`
  - Previous query fetched `tokensJsons` (huge JSON), `json`, full document paths (pdfFile, txtExtractFile, pawlsParseFile), full corpus details
  - New query fetches only: id, created, creator (id, email, username), corpus (id, slug, labelSet.title), document (id, slug, title), annotationLabel (id, text, color, labelType), analysis (id, analyzer.analyzerId), annotationType, structural, rawText, isPublic, contentModalities
  - Expected improvement: ~90% payload reduction, significantly faster load times
  - Files: `frontend/src/views/Annotations.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/annotations/CorpusAnnotationCards.tsx`

### Added

#### GraphQL Corpus Query Optimization

- **Added `documentCount` field to CorpusType**: Efficient document count using annotated subquery instead of N+1 queries
  - For list queries (`corpuses`), the resolver annotates `_document_count` via `DocumentPath` subquery
  - For single corpus queries, falls back to model's `document_count()` method
  - Files: `config/graphql/graphene_types.py:2028-2038`, `config/graphql/queries.py:836-869`
- **Added `annotationCount` field to CorpusType**: Efficient annotation count using annotated subquery
  - For list queries, `resolve_corpuses` annotates `_annotation_count` via Document→DocumentPath join
  - For single corpus queries, falls back to counting via DocumentPath query
  - Files: `config/graphql/graphene_types.py`, `config/graphql/queries.py`
- **Optimized LabelSet count resolvers**: Label counts now use corpus-annotated values when available
  - `resolve_label_set` on CorpusType copies annotated counts to LabelSet instance
  - `resolve_doc_label_count`, `resolve_span_label_count`, `resolve_token_label_count` check for annotations before querying
  - Files: `config/graphql/graphene_types.py:680-699, 2040-2056`
- **Optimized leaderboard `reputationGlobal` resolution**: `resolve_global_leaderboard` now attaches `_reputation_global` to user objects, avoiding N+1 queries when resolving `reputationGlobal`
  - Files: `config/graphql/queries.py`, `config/graphql/graphene_types.py`
- **Added query optimization tests**: Comprehensive tests for `documentCount`, `annotationCount`, and label set optimization
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_query_optimization.py`

### Changed

#### DiscoveryLanding GraphQL Query Optimization

- **Removed unused fields from landing page queries**: Eliminates ~39 N+1 queries per landing page load
  - Removed from `GET_DISCOVERY_DATA`: `chatMessages { totalCount }` (unused by ActivitySection), `totalMessages`, `totalThreadsCreated`, `totalAnnotationsCreated` (unused by CompactLeaderboard)
  - Replaced `documents { totalCount }` and `annotations { totalCount }` with `documentCount` and `annotationCount` (efficient subquery-backed fields)
  - Files: `frontend/src/graphql/landing-queries.ts`
- **Updated FeaturedCollections to use optimized count fields**: Uses `documentCount`/`annotationCount` instead of connection `totalCount`
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/landing/FeaturedCollections.tsx`
- **Updated TrendingCorpuses to use optimized count fields**: Uses `documentCount` instead of `documents.totalCount`
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/landing/TrendingCorpuses.tsx`
- **Updated RecentDiscussions to remove chatMessages dependency**: Display "View thread" instead of reply count
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/landing/RecentDiscussions.tsx`

#### Frontend Corpus Query Cleanup

- **Removed unused fields from GET_CORPUSES query**: Reduces payload and eliminates N+1 queries
  - Removed: `preferredEmbedder`, `appliedAnalyzerIds`, `documents.edges`, `annotations.totalCount`
  - Added: `documentCount` (efficient server-side count)
  - Files: `frontend/src/graphql/queries.ts:603-673`
- **Updated CorpusItem to use documentCount**: Uses new field instead of `documents?.edges?.length`
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusItem.tsx:602-605`
- **Updated CorpusListView formatStats function**: Uses `documentCount` and removes annotation count display
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusListView.tsx:303-306`
- **Added documentCount and annotationCount to TypeScript types**: Updated `RawCorpusType` interface
  - Files: `frontend/src/types/graphql-api.ts`

### Technical Details

- **Query reduction**: DiscoveryLanding page goes from ~39 N+1 queries to ~0 extra queries (all counts resolved via subqueries or removed)
- **Backward compatibility**: All new fields (`documentCount`, `annotationCount`) gracefully fall back to model methods for single corpus queries
- **Pattern**: Label counts are passed from corpus to label_set via instance attribute injection in `resolve_label_set`
- **Pattern**: Leaderboard reputation score is pre-attached to user objects via `_reputation_global` attribute

### Added

#### 2048-Dimensional Embedding Support

- **Added vector_2048 field to Embedding model**: Support for 2048-dimensional embeddings used by newer embedding models
  - Migration 0061 adds nullable `vector_2048` column to `annotations_embedding` table
  - Files: `opencontractserver/annotations/models.py:470`, `opencontractserver/annotations/migrations/0061_add_vector_2048.py`
- **Updated dimension handling across codebase**:
  - `Managers.py:_get_vector_field_name` returns "vector_2048" for 2048-dim vectors (lines 363-364)
  - `mixins.py:_dimension_to_field` returns embedding relation for 2048-dim (lines 37-38)
  - `mixins.py:get_embedding` retrieves 2048-dim vectors (lines 144-145)
  - Vector stores validate 2048 as supported dimension
  - Files: `opencontractserver/shared/Managers.py`, `opencontractserver/shared/mixins.py`, `opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/core_vector_stores.py`, `opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/core_conversation_vector_stores.py`

#### Multimodal Embedder Refactoring

- **Refactored MultimodalMicroserviceEmbedder into inheritance hierarchy**:

### Fixed

#### Embedder Error Handling and Response Parsing (PR #828)

- **Fixed silent embedding failures**: Added `EmbeddingGenerationError` exception class that triggers Celery task retries when default embeddings fail
  - Default embedding failures now properly raise and retry (up to 3 times with 60s delay)
  - Corpus-specific embedding failures are logged but don't fail the task (non-fatal)
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/embeddings_task.py:165-273`
- **Fixed 1D vs 2D array response parsing**: Embedders now handle both array formats from embedding services
  - Some services return `[0.1, 0.2, ...]` (1D), others return `[[0.1, 0.2, ...]]` (2D batch format)
  - Previously caused "object of type 'float' has no len()" errors

  - Files: `opencontractserver/pipeline/embedders/sent_transformer_microservice.py:120-133`
- **Added comprehensive test coverage**: 18 new tests for error handling, bytes decoding, and array format parsing
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_embeddings_task.py`
- **Added TestEmbedder for fast, deterministic test embeddings**: Tests now use a fast in-memory embedder by default instead of the HTTP-based MicroserviceEmbedder
  - Returns deterministic fake vectors based on text hash (same text = same embedding)
  - Eliminates HTTP round-trips to vector-embedder service during tests (faster test execution)
  - Integration tests that need real service connectivity should explicitly instantiate MicroserviceEmbedder
  - Files: `opencontractserver/pipeline/embedders/test_embedder.py`, `config/settings/test.py:120-134`

#### Cache Eviction Consistency

- **Fixed folder document counts not updating after bulk removal**: Added `corpusFolders` cache eviction to `REMOVE_DOCUMENTS_FROM_CORPUS` mutation to match the pattern used by `MOVE_DOCUMENT_TO_FOLDER`
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/corpuses/folders/RemoveDocumentsModal.tsx:109-112`

#### Duplicate Tool Registration and Caller Tool Precedence

- **Fixed duplicate tool registration error in PydanticAI agent**: Resolved `pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError` when caller-provided tools have the same name as default tools
  - Files: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py:2063-2082`
- **Caller-provided tools now take precedence over defaults**: When a caller passes a tool with the same name as a built-in default, the caller's tool configuration (description, requires_approval, etc.) is now used instead of silently dropping it
  - Allows callers to override tool behavior and configurations
  - Applies to both `PydanticAIDocumentAgent.create()` and `structured_response()`
  - Added info-level logging when caller tools override defaults
  - Files: `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py:961-992`, `opencontractserver/llms/agents/pydantic_ai_agents.py:2063-2082`
- **Added comprehensive test coverage**:
  - `test_caller_tool_overrides_default_configuration` verifies caller's tool is used (not default)
  - `test_config_tools_deduplicated_in_structured_response` covers the config.tools path
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_duplicate_tool_registration.py`
- **Fixed PydanticAICorpusAgent consistency**: Now uses same caller-precedence pattern as document agent
- **Extracted `deduplicate_tools()` utility**: DRY refactor moves repeated deduplication logic to reusable function
  - Checks both `__name__` and `name` attributes for tool identification
  - Filters out `None` values to handle tools without names
  - Includes security documentation in docstring
  - Files: `opencontractserver/utils/tools.py`
- **Added documentation for tool precedence**: New section in LLM docs explaining when conflicts occur, which configuration wins, and security considerations
  - Files: `docs/architecture/llms/README.md`

- **24 unit tests**: Comprehensive coverage of new functionality
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_pipeline_hardening.py`

#### Bifurcated Conversation Permissions (CHAT vs THREAD)

- **New `conversation_type` field on Conversation model**: Distinguishes between personal agent chats and collaborative discussions
  - `CHAT` type: Restrictive permissions (creator + explicit permissions + public only)
  - `THREAD` type: Context-based permissions (inherits visibility from linked corpus/document)
  - Files: `opencontractserver/conversations/models.py:51-53`, `opencontractserver/conversations/migrations/`
- **Bifurcated `visible_to_user()` queryset method**: Different visibility logic based on conversation type
  - CHAT: Only creator, explicit guardian permissions, or public flag
  - THREAD: CHAT rules + context inheritance (READ on corpus AND/OR document)
  - AND logic when both corpus and document are linked (must have READ on both)
  - Files: `opencontractserver/conversations/models.py:127-238`
- **ConversationQueryOptimizer helper class**: Request-level caching to avoid N+1 queries

- **22 new permission tests**: Comprehensive coverage of CHAT vs THREAD behavior
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_conversation_permissions.py`
- **Updated permissioning guide**: Documentation for bifurcated model with examples
  - Files: `docs/permissioning/consolidated_permissioning_guide.md`

#### Corpus Forking: Folder and Relationship Preservation

- **Folder hierarchy preservation during fork**: Forked corpora now maintain the complete folder structure
  - Folders cloned in tree-depth order to preserve parent-child relationships
  - Documents retain their folder assignments in the forked corpus
  - Uses `tree_queries` CTE with `.with_tree_fields()` for proper ordering
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/fork_tasks.py:126-159`, `config/graphql/mutations.py:1180-1187`
- **Relationship preservation during fork**: Annotation relationships are now copied
  - Source and target annotations remapped to forked annotation IDs
  - Relationship labels preserved via label_map
  - Uses `prefetch_related()` for efficient M2M loading
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/fork_tasks.py:286-356`

- **Upload constants**: Added `UPLOAD.MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` and `DEBOUNCE.CORPUS_SEARCH_MS` to `frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts`

#### Pre-extracted Image Content for Annotations

- **`image_content_file` FileField on Annotation model**: Stores pre-extracted image data as JSON files
  - Eliminates need to reload full PAWLs file (~10MB) for each image embedding request
  - Performance improvement: ~10-20x faster for image annotation embeddings
  - Files: `opencontractserver/annotations/models.py:109-114`
  - Migration: `opencontractserver/annotations/migrations/0060_add_annotation_image_content_file.py`
- **Batch image extraction utilities**: Efficient batch processing during annotation creation
  - `extract_and_store_annotation_images()` - extracts images from PAWLs and stores as JSON
  - `batch_extract_annotation_images()` - batch processes multiple annotations sharing PAWLs data
  - Files: `opencontractserver/utils/multimodal_embeddings.py:351-502`
- **Unique constraints on Embedding model**: Database-level prevention of duplicate embeddings
  - Migration: `opencontractserver/annotations/migrations/0059_add_embedding_unique_constraints.py`

#### Corpus-Specific Embeddings

- **Dual embedding strategy**: Creates both default (global search) and corpus-specific embeddings
  - Default embedder for cross-corpus search compatibility
  - Corpus-preferred embedder for corpus-specific semantic search
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/embeddings_task.py:88-160`
- **Corpus ID propagation through ingestion chain**: Parser now receives corpus context
  - Enables corpus-specific embeddings during document ingestion
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/doc_tasks.py:203-248`, `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/parser.py:130-143`

### Fixed

- **Corpus title not getting [FORK] prefix**: Fixed f-string that did nothing (`f"{corpus.title}"` → `f"[FORK] {corpus.title}"`)
  - Files: `config/graphql/mutations.py:1199`
- **tree_depth ordering error**: Removed explicit `order_by("tree_depth", "pk")` and rely on default `tree_ordering` from `with_tree_fields()`. The `tree_depth` field is CTE-computed and only available at SQL execution time, not during Django's `order_by()` validation.
  - Files: `config/graphql/mutations.py:1184`, `opencontractserver/tasks/fork_tasks.py:133`, `opencontractserver/utils/corpus_forking.py:46`, `opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_fork_round_trip.py:389`
- **Fork fails with corpuses without label_set**: Added conditional handling to skip label set cloning when corpus has no label_set
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/fork_tasks.py:56-136`
- **Document slug uniqueness violation during fork**: Clear slug before saving forked document so save() generates a new unique slug
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/fork_tasks.py:186`
- **Annotation label mapping error**: Gracefully handle annotations without labels or when label_map is empty
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tasks/fork_tasks.py:279-285`
- **Test assertion bug**: Fixed comparison of count to queryset (`forked_labelset_labels.count() == original_labelset_labels.all()` → `.count() == .count()`)
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_forking.py:99`
- **Incorrect CorpusFolder permission setting in tests**: Removed `set_permissions_for_obj_to_user()` call for folders - CorpusFolder inherits permissions from parent Corpus, not individual permissions per the consolidated permissioning guide
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_corpus_fork_round_trip.py:277`
- **Critical: Infinite loop in corpus document copies**: Fixed chain reaction where corpus copies triggered re-ingestion
  - **Root Cause**: `add_document()` created corpus copies without setting `processing_started`, causing the ingestion signal to fire on each copy
  - **Impact**: Uploading one document created infinite chain of copies (doc → copy → copy of copy → ...)
  - **Fix**: Set `processing_started=timezone.now()` on corpus copies to prevent signal from firing
  - **Files**: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:478-481`
- **Multimodal embeddings for structural annotations**: Fixed PAWLs loading from `structural_set.pawls_parse_file`
  - Structural annotations now correctly load images for embedding generation
  - Files: `opencontractserver/utils/multimodal_embeddings.py:136-166`
- **Embedding duplicate constraint violations with race condition handling**
  - **Root Cause**: Parallel Celery workers could create duplicate embeddings due to race conditions between check and create
  - **Fix**: Added `IntegrityError` catch in `store_embedding()` to handle race conditions atomically
  - **Fix**: Migration 0059 now cleans up existing duplicates before adding unique constraints (keeps best embedding per group)
  - **Fix**: Migration uses `atomic=False` to avoid PostgreSQL "pending trigger events" error
  - **Fix**: Removed `visible_to_user()` filtering from existence checks (constraints apply globally)
  - **Files**: `opencontractserver/shared/Managers.py:369-442`, `opencontractserver/annotations/migrations/0059_add_embedding_unique_constraints.py`

### Changed

- **Permission consistency**: Utility function `build_fork_corpus_task()` now uses `PermissionTypes.CRUD` (was `ALL`) to match mutation
  - Files: `opencontractserver/utils/corpus_forking.py:69`
- **`BulkUploadModal`** is now a thin wrapper: `<UploadModal forceMode="bulk" />`
- **`DocumentUploadModal`** is now a thin wrapper: `<UploadModal forceMode="single" />`
- **Image retrieval uses fast path**: Both REST API and embedding tasks check `image_content_file` first
  - Falls back to PAWLs loading only for legacy annotations without pre-extracted images
  - Files: `opencontractserver/llms/tools/image_tools.py:281-349`, `opencontractserver/utils/multimodal_embeddings.py:101-127`
- **`import_annotations()` accepts `pawls_data` parameter**: Enables batch image extraction during import
  - Files: `opencontractserver/utils/importing.py:58-150`
- **`StructuralAnnotationSet.duplicate()` copies image files**: Preserves pre-extracted images during corpus isolation
  - Files: `opencontractserver/annotations/models.py:705-745`
-

- Removed obsolete files: `corpus_forking_edit_plan.md`, `corpus_forking_remediation_plan.md`
- Migrated from Semantic UI to `@os-legal/ui` design system (Modal, Button, Input, Progress, etc.)
- Uses `--oc-*` CSS design tokens for consistent theming
- Debounce cleanup on unmount to prevent memory leaks
- Sequential uploads to avoid server overload (documented trade-off)

### Removed

- **Deleted unused components**: `DocumentUploadList.tsx`, `DocumentListItem.tsx`

### Security

- **JWT authentication error message hardening** (CWE-209: Information Exposure Through Error Messages)
  - JWT errors now return generic messages (`"Invalid token"`) instead of exposing exception details
  - Detailed errors logged server-side only for debugging
  - Files: `config/rest_jwt_auth.py:80-90`
- **Sensitive data redaction in logs** (CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)
  - New `redact_sensitive_kwargs()` utility recursively redacts API keys, secrets, passwords, tokens, credentials
  - Applied to parser, embedder, and post-processor kwargs logging
  - Files: `opencontractserver/utils/logging.py`, `opencontractserver/tasks/doc_tasks.py`,
    `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/embedder.py`, `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/post_processor.py`,
    `opencontractserver/pipeline/parsers/llamaparse_parser.py`, `opencontractserver/pipeline/post_processors/pdf_redactor.py`

### Added

- **Unified JWT authentication utility**: Single entry point for token validation across all API surfaces
  - Automatic handling of both Auth0 (RS256/JWKS) and standard graphql_jwt (HS256) tokens
  - DRY architecture eliminates conditional Auth0/non-Auth0 switching in multiple files
  - Files: `config/jwt_utils.py` (NEW)
- **GraphQL content_modalities field exposure**: Added to AnnotationType schema
  - Enables frontend to filter annotations by modality
  - Files: `config/graphql/graphene_types.py`

### Fixed

- **Image annotations now clearly visible**: Image and mixed-modality annotations display properly in UnifiedContentFeed
  - Previously showed as empty text with no indication of content
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/annotator/sidebar/HighlightItem.tsx:163-167,225,249`
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/knowledge_base/document/unified_feed/ContentItemRenderer.tsx:218`
- **Structural annotations now return images**: Fixed image retrieval for structural annotations without direct document references
  - **Root Cause**: `get_annotation_images_with_permission()` returned empty array for structural annotations (no `document` field)
  - **Fix**: Load PAWLs data from `structural_set.pawls_parse_file` when document is None
  - **Impact**: Structural image annotations (e.g., figures, charts) now display thumbnails in UI
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `opencontractserver/llms/tools/image_tools.py:220-305` - Added `_extract_image_from_pawls()` helper
    - `opencontractserver/llms/tools/image_tools.py:278-305` - Updated `get_annotation_images()` to check structural_set
    - `opencontractserver/llms/tools/image_tools.py:434-492` - Updated `get_annotation_images_with_permission()` for structural permissions

  - **Text Parser**: Sets content_modalities to `["TEXT"]` for all text-only annotations
    - Files: `opencontractserver/pipeline/parsers/oc_text_parser.py:108`
  - **Backfill Command**: Created management command to populate existing annotations with missing content_modalities
    - Analyzes token references in PAWLs data to determine modalities
    - Fallback: Uses annotation label text as hint (e.g., "image", "figure", "chart")
    - Files: `opencontractserver/annotations/management/commands/populate_content_modalities.py`
    - Usage: `python manage.py populate_content_modalities [--dry-run] [--force]`

### Changed

- **Unified JWT authentication architecture**: Refactored authentication to use single shared utility
  - **REST API**: `config/rest_jwt_auth.py` now uses `jwt_utils.get_user_from_jwt_token()`
  - **WebSocket**: Unified `JWTAuthMiddleware` replaces separate Auth0/non-Auth0 middlewares
    - Files: `config/websocket/middleware.py` - Single middleware handles both token types
    - Files: `config/websocket/middlewares/websocket_auth0_middleware.py` - Now alias to unified middleware (deprecated)
  - **ASGI**: Simplified `config/asgi.py` to use single middleware instead of conditional switching
  - **Benefit**: DRY architecture - token validation logic centralized in one place

### Removed

- **NLM Ingest Parser**: Removed legacy NLM-Ingest PDF parser in favor of Docling (default) and LlamaParse
  - **Rationale**: Docling provides superior ML-based parsing with better structure extraction; NLM parser was rarely used
  - **Migration**: Users with `PDF_PARSER=nlm` should switch to `PDF_PARSER=docling` (default) or `PDF_PARSER=llamaparse`
  - **Files Removed**:
    - `opencontractserver/pipeline/parsers/nlm_ingest_parser.py`
    - `opencontractserver/tests/test_doc_parser_nlm_ingest.py`
    - `docs/pipelines/nlm_ingest_parser.md`
  - **Settings Updated**: Removed `nlm` option from `_PDF_PARSER_MAP` in `config/settings/base.py`

### Technical Details

- **Backend**: REST endpoint leverages existing permission-checked `image_tools.py` functions
- **Frontend hook**: `useAnnotationImages` conditionally fetches images only for IMAGE modality (performance optimization)
- **TypeScript types**: Added `contentModalities?: string[]` to annotation types
  - Files: `frontend/src/types/graphql-api.ts:147`
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/annotator/types/annotations.ts:92,145`
- **Test coverage**: 5 backend tests for REST endpoint with authentication and permission checking
  - Files: `opencontractserver/tests/test_annotation_images_api.py`

### Added

#### Corpus-Isolated Structural Annotations

- **StructuralAnnotationSet duplication per corpus**: Each corpus now gets its own copy of structural annotations when documents are added
  - Enables multi-embedder support (each corpus can use different embedding models)
  - Maintains consistent per-corpus vector spaces for similarity search
  - Files: `opencontractserver/annotations/models.py`, `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py`
- **Extended content_hash format**: Changed from `{sha256}` to `{sha256}_{corpus_id}` (max 128 chars)
  - Migration: `opencontractserver/annotations/migrations/0056_alter_structuralannotationset_content_hash.py`

- **Removed source_document provenance**: `source_document_id` no longer set when adding documents to corpus
- **Structural annotations no longer shared**: Each corpus gets duplicated structural annotation sets
- **Updated documentation**: Rewrote `structural_vs_non_structural_annotations.md`, updated `document_versioning.md`, `documents_and_annotations.md`

#### Multimodal Support

- Extended PAWLs token format to support unified image tokens (`is_image=True`)
- Updated `BaseEmbedder` to use `ContentModality` enum instead of boolean flags
- Updated `PipelineComponentDefinition` in registry to store `supported_modalities`

### Fixed

#### Android Share URL Missing Entity Prefix (PR #795)

- **Bug**: Android native share was dropping entity type prefixes (`/c/`, `/d/`, `/e/`) from shared URLs
- **Root Cause**: `frontend/src/components/seo/MetaTags.tsx:50-56` was generating canonical URLs as `/{userSlug}/{entitySlug}` instead of `/{prefix}/{userSlug}/{entitySlug}`
- **Impact**: Links shared via Android browser resulted in 404s (e.g., `/john/my-corpus` instead of `/c/john/my-corpus`)
- **Fix**: Refactored `MetaTags.tsx` to use existing `buildCanonicalPath()` utility from `navigationUtils.ts`
- **Added**: Unit tests for MetaTags canonical URL generation (`frontend/src/components/seo/__tests__/MetaTags.test.tsx`)
- **Added**: Development warning for unexpected `entityType` values
- **Added**: Enhanced Cloudflare worker request logging for crawler debugging (`cloudflare-og-worker/src/index.ts`)

### Security

#### WebSocket Agent Permission Vulnerability Fixed (PR #792)

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed permission bypass in legacy WebSocket consumers
  - `config/websocket/consumers/corpus_conversation.py` - No permission checks
  - `config/websocket/consumers/document_conversation.py` - No permission checks
  - `config/websocket/consumers/standalone_document_conversation.py` - No permission checks
  - **Impact**: Any authenticated user could access ANY document/corpus via WebSocket
- **Solution**: Migrated to `UnifiedAgentConsumer` with three-layer permission model:
  - Consumer layer validates READ permission at WebSocket connect time (`config/websocket/consumers/unified_agent_conversation.py:93-187`)
  - Tool filtering layer removes write tools for read-only users (`opencontractserver/llms/agents/agent_factory.py:178-210`)
  - Runtime layer validates permissions before every tool execution (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/pydantic_ai_tools.py:20-111`)
- **Defense-in-depth**: Added `_check_user_permissions()` function that validates user has READ permission on document/corpus before any tool execution
- **Tool permission flags**: Added `requires_write_permission` flag to `CoreTool` (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_factory.py:45-50`)
- **Write tools protected**: `add_document_note`, `update_document_summary`, `update_corpus_description`, `duplicate_annotations`

### Added

  - Records general requests (`mcp_request`): endpoint, method, transport type, success/failure
  - Privacy-preserving: Uses salted SHA-256 IP hashing for unique user counting (raw IPs are never sent to PostHog)
  - Support for all MCP transports: streamable_http, sse, stdio
  - No query content or outputs are captured - only usage metadata
- **Telemetry integration in MCP server** (`opencontractserver/mcp/server.py`):

  - Previously, superuser features (Badge Management, Admin Settings) were broken in non-Auth0 mode
  - Updated `LoginOutputs` interface to include `username`, `isUsageCapped`, and `isSuperuser` fields

### Fixed

#### WebSocket Connection Performance (Issue: Chat "Reconnecting" delay)

- **Auth0 JWKS caching** (`config/graphql_auth0_auth/utils.py:17-38`): Added in-memory cache for Auth0 JWKS with 10-minute TTL
  - Previously fetched JWKS from Auth0 on every token validation, causing 6-10 second delays
  - Now caches JWKS keys, reducing subsequent WebSocket auth to near-instant

- **Notification navigation fallback** (`frontend/src/components/notifications/NotificationDropdown.tsx:182-188`, `NotificationCenter.tsx:207-213`): Added fallback navigation to `/discussions` when corpus slug data is missing. Previously, users clicking notifications with missing slug data would see no response.
- **Network-only fetch policy optimization** (`frontend/src/routing/CentralRouteManager.tsx:621-632`): Changed thread resolution corpus query from `network-only` to `cache-and-network` since `authInitComplete` now ensures `clearStore()` completes before route queries run. This improves navigation performance when corpus data is already cached.
- **Unit test coverage** (`frontend/src/utils/__tests__/navigationUtils.test.ts:497-503`): Added missing test for `parseRoute("/discussions")` to prevent regression of discussions route parsing.

#### Type Safety and Bug Fixes

- **User email detection** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusListView.tsx:345-349`): Fixed currentUserEmail logic to use `userObj` reactive variable from Apollo cache instead of inferring from corpus permissions - prevents filter failures when no corpus has CAN_REMOVE permission
- **TypeScript type casts** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusListView.tsx`, `CorpusModal.tsx`): Removed 7 `as any` type casts by correcting `CorpusType.categories` type from `CorpusCategoryTypeConnection` to `CorpusCategoryType[]` to match backend GraphQL schema

#### Impact

- Frontend can now distinguish between expired tokens (4001) and invalid tokens (4002) via WebSocket close codes
- Enables targeted token refresh vs full re-authentication based on close code
- Fixes issue #744 where token expiration wasn't properly signaled to clients

### Added

  - Tests for successful parsing with layout extraction
  - Tests for markdown mode without layout
  - Tests for bounding box format conversion (fractional, absolute, array)
  - Tests for annotation creation and token generation
  - Tests for error handling (missing API key, API errors, empty results)
  - Tests for configuration via settings and kwargs override

#### Thread/Message Triggered Corpus Actions for Automated Moderation

- **Extended CorpusActionTrigger enum** with `NEW_THREAD` and `NEW_MESSAGE` triggers (`opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:849-854`) to enable automated moderation of discussion threads
- **New moderation tools** (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/moderation_tools.py`): 9 tools for thread moderation including:
  - `get_thread_context`: Retrieve thread metadata (title, creator, lock/pin status)
  - `get_thread_messages`: Get recent messages for context
  - `get_message_content`: Get full content of a specific message
  - `delete_message`: Soft delete a message with audit logging
  - `lock_thread`/`unlock_thread`: Control thread access
  - `add_thread_message`: Post agent messages to threads
  - `pin_thread`/`unpin_thread`: Feature important threads
- **New MODERATION tool category** (`opencontractserver/llms/tools/tool_registry.py:42`) with 9 registered tools and proper approval requirements
- **Signal handlers** for thread/message creation (`opencontractserver/corpuses/signals.py`) using `transaction.on_commit` pattern to trigger corpus actions
- **New Celery tasks** (`opencontractserver/tasks/corpus_tasks.py`):
  - `process_thread_corpus_action`: Processes actions when threads are created

- Thread management (e.g., auto-lock threads discussing prohibited topics)
- Automated responses (e.g., welcome messages for new threads)
- Content classification (e.g., auto-pin important announcements)

#### Proactive Apollo Cache Management System (PR #725)

- **New `CacheManager` service** (`frontend/src/services/cacheManager.ts`): Centralized Apollo cache management with debouncing, targeted invalidation, and auth-aware cache operations
  - `resetOnAuthChange()`: Full cache clear with optional refetch for login/logout transitions

### Technical Details

#### LlamaParse Parser Architecture

- Uses `llama-parse` library for API communication
- JSON mode with `extract_layout=True` provides bounding boxes as fractions of page dimensions (0-1)
- Converts LlamaParse layout elements to OpenContracts structural annotations
- Generates PAWLS tokens by splitting text into words and distributing across bounding box
- Element type mapping converts LlamaParse labels (title, paragraph, table, etc.) to OpenContracts annotation labels
- Falls back to text extraction mode when layout extraction is disabled

#### Markdown Link Tool Implementation

- Follows OpenContracts routing patterns from `docs/frontend/routing_system.md`
- Uses `select_related()` to minimize database queries (single query per entity)
- Handles both standalone documents and corpus-based document contexts
- Entity validation with clear error messages for IDOR prevention
- URL patterns match frontend `navigationUtils.ts` for consistency

### Fixed

#### Token Expiration Signal to Frontend (Issue #744)

- **Fixed `Auth0RemoteUserJSONWebTokenBackend.authenticate()` swallowing `JSONWebTokenExpired` exceptions** (`config/graphql_auth0_auth/backends.py:44-52`):
  - Previously, when a JWT token expired, the authentication backend caught all exceptions and returned `None`
  - The GraphQL layer then returned a generic "User is not authenticated" error
  - Frontend's `errorLink.ts` could not detect token expiration and trigger automatic refresh
  - Fix: Re-raise `JSONWebTokenExpired` so the GraphQL layer returns "Signature has expired"
  - Frontend now correctly detects expiration and triggers page reload for silent token refresh
- **Enhanced WebSocket middleware with auth error signaling** (`config/websocket/middleware.py:44-124`):
  - Added `scope["auth_error"]` dict with `code` and `message` fields
  - New close codes: `WS_CLOSE_TOKEN_EXPIRED` (4001), `WS_CLOSE_TOKEN_INVALID` (4002)
  - Consumers can now close connections with specific codes for frontend handling
- **Enhanced Auth0 WebSocket middleware** (`config/websocket/middlewares/websocket_auth0_middleware.py:52-130`):
  - Added consistent `scope["auth_error"]` handling for Auth0 tokens
  - Matches close code behavior with non-Auth0 middleware
- **New test coverage** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_token_expiration.py`):
  - Tests for `Auth0RemoteUserJSONWebTokenBackend` token expiration re-raising
  - Tests for WebSocket middleware auth error handling
  - Tests for WebSocket close code consistency

#### Independent Structural Annotation and Show Selected Controls (Issue #735)

- **Removed forced coupling between structural and showSelectedOnly controls** (`frontend/src/components/annotator/controls/AnnotationControls.tsx:200-207`):
  - Previously, enabling "Show Structural" would force "Show Only Selected" to be checked and disabled
  - Users can now toggle "Show Only Selected" independently when structural annotations are visible
  - All combinations now work:
    - Show all structural annotations: structural ON, selectedOnly OFF
    - Show only selected structural annotation: structural ON, selectedOnly ON
    - Hide all structural annotations: structural OFF
- **Updated checkbox onChange handler** (`frontend/src/components/annotator/controls/AnnotationControls.tsx:268`): Now correctly extracts `data?.checked ?? false` for consistency with other toggle handlers
- **Updated component tests** (`frontend/tests/FloatingDocumentControls.ct.tsx:263-371`):
  - Renamed test to reflect new independent behavior
  - Added new test verifying controls can be toggled independently
- **Note**: Users who previously had `showStructural: true` will notice different behavior: the "Show Only Selected" control now respects their actual preference instead of being forced to true

#### Cache Management Race Condition Fix (PR #725)

- **Auth state now set BEFORE cache clear** (`frontend/src/components/auth/AuthGate.tsx:69-92`, `frontend/src/views/Login.tsx:106-117`, `frontend/src/components/layout/useNavMenu.ts:64-90`):
  - Previously, cache was cleared before updating auth state, creating a window where queries could fetch with wrong auth context
  - Fixed by setting auth token/user/status first, then clearing cache
  - Refetched queries now correctly use the new auth context
- **AuthGate uses useCacheManager hook** (`frontend/src/components/auth/AuthGate.tsx:7,27`): Replaced direct `new CacheManager()` instantiation with proper hook usage, eliminating `as any` type assertion and ensuring memoization
- **Fire-and-forget logout cache clear** (`frontend/src/components/layout/useNavMenu.ts:69-79`): Logout no longer blocks on cache clear operation, improving perceived performance

### Technical Details

#### Cache Management Architecture

- **Race condition prevention**: Auth state updates are synchronous; cache clear is async. By setting auth first, any queries triggered during cache clear use the correct credentials.
- **Singleton pattern preserved for non-React contexts**: The singleton functions (`initializeCacheManager`, `getCacheManager`, etc.) remain exported for testing and non-React usage, with documentation clarifying when to use hooks vs singleton.
- **Dependency management**: `useCacheManager` hook returns stable callback references via `useCallback`, safe to include in effect dependencies.

### Fixed

#### Mobile Responsive Styling for Settings and Badge Widgets (Issue #690)

- **Badge component z-index optimization** (`frontend/src/components/badges/Badge.tsx:47,107`): Lowered z-index values from 9999/10000 to 200/201 to avoid conflicts with other UI elements while maintaining proper layering
- **Unified mobile behavior detection** (`frontend/src/components/badges/Badge.tsx:148-152`): Combined touch device detection with viewport width check to ensure mobile UX works consistently across real devices and test environments
- **Test wrapper extraction** (`frontend/tests/UserBadgesTestWrapper.tsx`, `frontend/tests/GlobalSettingsPanelTestWrapper.tsx`): Moved test wrappers to separate files following Playwright component testing best practices
- **Improved test reliability** (`frontend/tests/mobile-responsive.ct.tsx`): Fixed element disambiguation issues using proper locator strategies

#### Agent Chat Processing Indicator (PR #687)

- **Added visual feedback for agent processing** (`frontend/src/components/widgets/chat/ChatMessage.tsx:1342-1405`): When an agent starts processing a response, an animated "Agent is thinking..." indicator now displays instead of an empty message bubble
- **Processing indicator conditions**: Shows when assistant message is incomplete with no content and no timeline entries
- **Accessibility improvements**: Added ARIA attributes (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-label`) for screen reader support
- **Animation performance**: Added `will-change: transform, opacity` to animated dots for smoother rendering
- **Component tests**: Added comprehensive Playwright component tests (`frontend/tests/chat-message-processing-indicator.ct.tsx`) covering indicator visibility, accessibility, and state transitions

### Fixed

#### Trash View Error Prevention (Issue #691)

- **State synchronization fix** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/folders/FolderTreeSidebar.tsx:363-369`):
  - Fixed trash folder click handler to use consistent state update pattern matching other folder navigation
  - Added `handleTrashClick` callback that properly delegates to `onFolderSelect` when provided (URL-driven state)
  - Removed direct Jotai atom manipulation that caused race conditions with CentralRouteManager
- **Defensive null handling** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/folders/TrashFolderView.tsx`):
  - Added `safeFormatDistanceToNow()` and `safeFormat()` helper functions for robust date formatting
  - Added optional chaining for `creator`, `document`, and nested properties to prevent runtime errors
  - Added validation in `handleRestoreSingle()` and `handleRestoreSelected()` to check for valid document data
- **Type safety improvements** (`frontend/src/graphql/queries/folders.ts:92-104`):
  - Updated `DeletedDocumentPathType` interface to mark `creator` and `document` as potentially null
  - Ensures TypeScript catches potential null access issues at compile time

### Added

#### Agent Message Visual Differentiation (Issue #688)

- **Enhanced MessageItem component** (`frontend/src/components/threads/MessageItem.tsx:27-50, 59-66, 68-191, 211-245, 461-466, 530-550`):
  - Agent detection logic using `getAgentDisplayData()` helper function
  - `hexToRgba()` utility for generating color-tinted backgrounds from agent badge colors
  - Distinct visual styling for agent messages vs user messages:
    - **Background**: Subtle gradient using agent's badge color with low opacity (8% to 3%)
    - **Border**: Colored border matching agent's badge color instead of default gray
    - **Accent strip**: 4px colored left border (like highlighted messages) using agent color
    - **Avatar**: Bot icon instead of User icon, with agent-colored gradient background
    - **Box shadow**: Agent-colored shadow on avatar for visual consistency
- **Accessibility improvements**:
  - Updated `aria-label` to include "(AI Agent)" suffix for screen readers
  - Avatar `title` attribute identifies agent name and type
- Agent color sourced from `AgentConfiguration.badgeConfig.color` field (falls back to default blue #4A90E2)

#### Network Recovery on Screen Unlock (Issue #697)

- **New `useNetworkStatus` hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts`): Monitors page visibility and network status changes to detect when the app resumes from background (e.g., screen unlock on mobile)
- **New `NetworkStatusHandler` component** (`frontend/src/components/network/NetworkStatusHandler.tsx`): Automatically refetches active Apollo Client queries when:
  - The page becomes visible after being hidden (screen unlock on mobile)
  - The network comes back online after being offline
- **WebSocket reconnection on resume**: Updated `useThreadWebSocket` and `useAgentChat` hooks to reconnect WebSockets when the page becomes visible
- **Toast notifications**: Informs users of connectivity changes ("Reconnecting...", "Connection restored", "You appear to be offline")

### Technical Details

#### Real-Time Notification System Architecture (Issue #637)

- **Security**: User-specific channel groups (`notification_user_{user_id}`) prevent IDOR and cross-user data leakage
- **Performance optimizations**:
  - User-specific WebSocket channels (not global broadcast)
  - Efficient `bulk_create()` for thread participant notifications
  - Exponential backoff on reconnection failures (2s → 4s → 8s → 16s, max 8x)
  - Heartbeat monitoring every 30s to detect stale connections
- **Signal integration**: All notification types (BADGE, REPLY, MENTION, THREAD_REPLY, moderation) automatically broadcast via `broadcast_notification_via_websocket()` helper
- **Error handling**: WebSocket broadcast failures don't break signal handlers - notifications still save to database
- **Connection lifecycle**: Auto-reconnection on network recovery, page visibility change, and authentication token refresh
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite (`opencontractserver/tests/test_notification_websocket.py`) covering authentication, IDOR prevention, concurrent connections, and signal integration
- **Network monitoring**: Integrated with `useNetworkStatus` hook for automatic reconnection on mobile screen unlock and network recovery

#### Network Recovery Implementation

- Uses `visibilitychange` event to detect page visibility changes
- Uses `online`/`offline` events to detect network status changes
- Configurable resume threshold (default 2s for NetworkStatusHandler, 1s for WebSocket hooks)
- Debounced refetch to prevent rapid repeated calls
- Graceful degradation: continues to work if events are not supported

#### Upload Modal Styling Improvements (Issue #696)

- **New styled components for upload modals** (`frontend/src/components/widgets/modals/UploadModalStyles.ts`): Comprehensive styled-components library with 25+ responsive components including `StyledUploadModal`, `DropZone`, `StepIndicator`, `FileListItem`, and more
- **Step indicator UI** for DocumentUploadModal showing progress through upload workflow (Select → Details → Corpus)
- **Modern gradient header** with icon and subtitle for both upload modals
- **Progress bar integration** showing real-time upload progress with success/error states

#### Mobile UI Improvements for Picker and Edit Message Modal (Issue #686)

- **Backend UpdateMessage mutation** (`config/graphql/conversation_mutations.py:455-619`):
  - New `UpdateMessageMutation` for editing existing thread messages
  - Validates CRUD permission on message or moderator status
  - Re-parses mentions when content is updated (with race condition protection - parsing happens before DB modifications)
  - Triggers agent responses for newly mentioned agents
  - Documented behavior: agents respond to ALL mentions, including re-mentions in edited messages
- **Frontend UPDATE_MESSAGE mutation** (`frontend/src/graphql/mutations.ts:2726-2760`): GraphQL mutation with TypeScript types
- **EditMessageModal component** (`frontend/src/components/threads/EditMessageModal.tsx`):
  - Full-screen modal on mobile for better touch interaction
  - Uses MessageComposer for consistent editing experience
  - Safe area insets for notched devices
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Custom unsaved changes confirmation modal (replaces browser `window.confirm()`)
  - Debounced content updates (150ms) for improved performance during typing
  - XSS protection documented: uses MarkdownMessageRenderer with `rehype-sanitize`
- **Message actions dropdown in MessageItem** (`frontend/src/components/threads/MessageItem.tsx:219-432`):
  - Desktop: Standard dropdown menu with Edit/Delete options
  - Mobile: Bottom sheet style for thumb-friendly interaction
  - Inline delete confirmation with mobile-optimized buttons
  - Backdrop overlay on mobile for visual focus

#### Improved Inline Reference Cards for Mentions (Issue #689)

- **Annotation mentions** now display the first ~24 characters of annotation text instead of cryptic IDs
  - Full annotation text accessible via hover tooltip
  - Falls back to label type if no raw text available
  - Location: `frontend/src/components/threads/MentionChip.tsx:212-229`
- **Document mentions** show document title with corpus context (e.g., "Document Title (in Corpus Name)")
  - Location: `frontend/src/components/threads/MessageComposer.tsx:361-375`
- **Corpus mentions** show corpus name instead of `@corpus:slug` format
  - Location: `frontend/src/components/threads/MessageComposer.tsx:351-359`
- **Shared constant** `MENTION_PREVIEW_LENGTH = 24` for consistent truncation across components
  - Location: `frontend/src/assets/configurations/constants.ts:6-8`
- **Text sanitization utility** for user-generated content to prevent XSS
  - Location: `frontend/src/utils/textSanitization.ts`
  - Unit tests: `frontend/src/utils/textSanitization.test.ts`
- **Component tests** for MentionChip covering all resource types and text truncation
  - Location: `frontend/tests/mention-chip.spec.tsx`

### Changed

- **DocumentUploadModal** (`frontend/src/components/widgets/modals/DocumentUploadModal.tsx`): Refactored to use new styled components with responsive grid layout for edit step
- **BulkUploadModal** (`frontend/src/components/widgets/modals/BulkUploadModal.tsx`): Complete visual overhaul with styled drop zone, file size display, and responsive layout
- **DocumentUploadList** (`frontend/src/components/documents/DocumentUploadList.tsx`): New drop zone styling with drag-active feedback and pulse animation
- **DocumentListItem** (`frontend/src/components/documents/DocumentListItem.tsx`): Improved file list items with proper touch targets (56px min-height, 64px on mobile), status icons, and delete button styling
- **Mobile-first breakpoints**: All upload modal components now have explicit breakpoints at 480px (mobile) and 768px (tablet)
- **Touch target compliance**: All interactive elements meet 44px minimum touch target size for mobile accessibility
- **Responsive action buttons**: Modal actions stack vertically on mobile for full-width tappable buttons
- **Custom scrollbar styling**: File list has styled scrollbars for visual polish

#### MentionChip Component Improvements (Issue #689)

- Extended `MentionChip` to support ANNOTATION type with green gradient styling
- Added default cases to all switch statements for TypeScript exhaustiveness checking
- Refactored `handleClick` to `handleActivation` accepting `React.MouseEvent | React.KeyboardEvent` union type (fixes unsafe `as any` assertion)
- Sanitized user-generated annotation text before display to prevent XSS

### Fixed

#### Mobile Layout for Picker Components (Issue #686)

- **Picker keyboard handling** (`MentionPicker.tsx:22-54`, `UnifiedMentionPicker.tsx:25-57`):
  - Added CSS environment variables (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`) for keyboard-aware positioning
  - Smooth slide-up animation for picker appearance
  - Max-height constraints using `min()` to prevent overflow on small screens
- **Touch targets** (`MentionPicker.tsx:83-108`, `UnifiedMentionPicker.tsx:96-108`):
  - Increased touch target size (52-60px min-height) for easier selection
  - Larger font size (15px) on mobile for readability
  - Mobile-specific border radius for rounded corners
- **MessageComposer mobile improvements** (`MessageComposer.tsx:48-93`):
  - Larger toolbar button touch targets (40x40px) on mobile
  - Increased gap between buttons for easier tapping

### Technical Details

#### Message Editing Tests (Issue #686)

- **New test for parent relationship preservation** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_conversation_mutations_graphql.py:1071-1168`):
  - Verifies that editing a reply message preserves its `parent_message` field
  - Ensures thread structure integrity when users edit replies
  - Part of comprehensive UpdateMessage mutation test suite

#### Upload Modal Architecture

- Styled-components with transient props (`$active`, `$selected`, `$status`) to prevent DOM attribute warnings
- CSS keyframe animations for drag-active pulse effect and fade-in modal transitions
- Gradient backgrounds using `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)` for visual consistency
- Semantic UI React components wrapped with styled-components for enhanced styling while preserving functionality

#### Permanent Deletion (Empty Trash) Functionality (PR #707)

- **Core deletion logic** (`opencontractserver/documents/versioning.py:617-760`):
  - `permanently_delete_document()`: Irreversible deletion with cascade cleanup
  - `permanently_delete_all_in_trash()`: Bulk deletion (empty trash) with partial success support
- **Cascade cleanup** deletes:
  - All DocumentPath records for the document in the corpus (entire history)
  - User annotations (non-structural) on the document
  - Relationships involving those annotations (uses Q objects to avoid duplicate counting)
  - DocumentSummaryRevision records for the document+corpus
  - The Document itself if no other corpus references it (Rule Q1)
- **Service layer** (`opencontractserver/corpuses/folder_service.py:1096-1181`): Permission-checked wrappers
- **GraphQL mutations** (`config/graphql/mutations.py:4069-4187`):
  - `PermanentlyDeleteDocument`: Delete single soft-deleted document
  - `EmptyTrash`: Delete all soft-deleted documents in corpus
  - Both enforce DELETE permission via django-guardian
- **Frontend UI** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/folders/TrashFolderView.tsx`):
  - "Empty Trash" button with confirmation modal
  - Warning message explaining what will be permanently deleted
  - Auto-dismiss success/error messages with configurable durations
  - TypeScript type safety for all mutation responses
- **Comprehensive test suite** (`opencontractserver/tests/test_permanent_deletion.py`): 34 tests covering core logic, cascade cleanup, Rule Q1, permissions, GraphQL mutations, and edge cases

### Technical Details

- Partial deletions are allowed in bulk operations (each document deletion is atomic)
- Structural annotations are preserved (shared via StructuralAnnotationSet)
- Corpus-isolated deletion: Only affects target corpus, other corpus references preserved
- Composite index `[corpus, is_current, is_deleted]` on DocumentPath for efficient trash queries

#### Mobile-Friendly Corpus Modal

- **New CorpusModal component** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusModal.tsx`): Purpose-built modal replacing CRUDModal for corpus create/edit/view operations with mobile-first design
- **13 comprehensive component tests** (`frontend/tests/corpus-modal.ct.tsx`): Full test coverage for all modal modes and interactions
- **Smart change detection for EDIT mode**: Only sends changed fields to backend using original value comparison (`CorpusModal.tsx:498-519`)
- **ARIA accessibility**: CloseButton includes `aria-label="Close modal"` for screen reader users

### Changed

#### Corpus Modal Architecture

- **Replaced CRUDModal with CorpusModal**: Simplified form handling with controlled inputs instead of complex JSON Schema Form library
- **Removed debug console.log statements** (`Corpuses.tsx`): Cleaned up 4 debug logging statements

### Technical Details

#### Corpus Modal Implementation

- Mobile-first responsive design: 16px input font prevents iOS auto-zoom, 48px min touch targets
- Proper TypeScript types: Icon type is `string | null` (not ArrayBuffer), slug field uses existing type from RawCorpusType
- isDirty computed by comparing current values against stored original values (not just tracking changes)

#### Social Media Preview (OG Metadata) System (PR #701)

- **Cloudflare Worker for social media previews** (`cloudflare-og-worker/`): Intercepts requests from social media crawlers (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, Slack, etc.) and returns HTML with Open Graph meta tags for rich link previews
- **Public OG metadata GraphQL queries** (`config/graphql/queries.py:3235-3403`): New unauthenticated queries for fetching public corpus, document, thread, and extract metadata
  - `ogCorpusMetadata`: Returns title, description, icon, document count for public corpuses
  - `ogDocumentMetadata`: Returns title, description, icon for public standalone documents
  - `ogDocumentInCorpusMetadata`: Returns document metadata with corpus context
  - `ogThreadMetadata`: Returns discussion thread metadata (title, corpus, message count)
  - `ogExtractMetadata`: Returns data extract metadata
- **Worker architecture**: Modular TypeScript implementation with crawler detection, URL parsing, metadata fetching, and HTML generation
- **Comprehensive documentation** (`docs/architecture/social-media-previews.md`): Architecture overview, deployment guide, and testing instructions

### Fixed

#### New Corpus Modal Mobile Issues (Issue #702)

- **Mobile form data loss in CorpusModal** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusModal.tsx:406-418`):
  - Fixed fields clearing when typing on mobile by tracking modal open transitions with `prevOpenRef` instead of resetting form on every render
  - The original `useEffect` was running on every `corpus` or `open` change, causing form state to reset during keyboard/focus events on mobile
- **Slow embedder loading** (`frontend/src/components/widgets/CRUD/EmbedderSelector.tsx:43-46`):
  - Changed Apollo query to `cache-first` policy since embedders rarely change
  - Prevents unnecessary network requests when reopening CorpusModal
- **Cramped mobile layout** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusModal.tsx:327-333`, `frontend/src/components/widgets/file-controls/FilePreviewAndUpload.tsx:54-57,129-135`):
  - Reduced icon upload area max-width from 200px to 150px on mobile
  - Reduced ImagePreview height from 150px to 100px on mobile
  - Made EditBadge smaller and better positioned on mobile viewports

#### Production Deployment

- **Missing COLLECTFAST_STRATEGY for GCP storage backend** (`config/settings/base.py:436`): Added `collectfast.strategies.gcloud.GoogleCloudStrategy` for GCP deployments. Previously, `collectfast` was installed in production but `COLLECTFAST_STRATEGY` was only configured for AWS, causing `collectstatic` to fail with `ImproperlyConfigured: No strategy configured` error when using `STORAGE_BACKEND=GCP`.
- **GCS static files ACL incompatible with uniform bucket-level access** (`opencontractserver/utils/storages.py:38`): Changed `StaticRootGoogleCloudStorage.default_acl` from `"publicRead"` to `None`. GCS buckets with uniform bucket-level access enabled cannot use per-object ACLs; access must be controlled via IAM policies at the bucket level instead.

#### Social Media Preview Security & Performance Fixes (PR #701 remediation)

- **Prevented potential infinite loop in worker passthrough** (`cloudflare-og-worker/src/index.ts:23-42`): Added `passToOrigin()` helper function with `X-OG-Worker-Pass` header to prevent Cloudflare Worker from re-invoking itself on route-based deployments
- **Added rate limiting to public OG queries** (`config/graphql/queries.py`): All five OG metadata resolvers now have `@graphql_ratelimit(key="ip", rate="60/m", group="og_metadata")` to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- **Fixed N+1 query in corpus document count** (`config/graphql/queries.py:3250-3255`): Changed from `corpus.documents.count()` to `Corpus.objects.annotate(doc_count=Count("documents"))` for single-query optimization
- **Fixed N+1 query in thread message count** (`config/graphql/queries.py:3359-3364`): Changed from `thread.messages.count()` to `Conversation.objects.annotate(msg_count=Count("messages"))` for single-query optimization
- **Added input validation for decodeURIComponent** (`cloudflare-og-worker/src/parser.ts:88-95`): Wrapped `decodeURIComponent()` in try-catch to handle malformed URLs gracefully instead of crashing the worker
- **Unified description truncation** (`config/graphql/queries.py`): Removed redundant Python-side `[:500]` truncation; description truncation now handled solely by the worker at 200 characters for consistency

### Added

#### Mobile UI/UX Improvements for Corpus Navigation

- **Mobile-first folder sidebar defaults**: Sidebar now collapses by default on mobile/tablet devices (≤768px) to maximize document viewing area

### Fixed

#### Mobile UI/UX Fixes

- **Settings button variable name bug** (`frontend/src/components/corpuses/CorpusHome.tsx:780`): Fixed `canUpdate` → `canEdit` reference error that prevented Settings button from displaying for users with update permissions
- **FAB z-index layering** (`frontend/src/views/Corpuses.tsx:1320`): Raised FAB z-index from 100 to 150 to ensure visibility above folder sidebar toggle (z-index: 101)
- **Explicit z-index layering**: Made mobile sidebar z-index layering explicit (backdrop: 98, toggle button: 99) to prevent fragile DOM-order-dependent behavior

#### Mobile Responsive Styling for Settings and Badge Widgets (PR #690)

- **UserSettingsModal responsive styling** (`frontend/src/components/modals/UserSettingsModal.tsx:14-80`):
  - Modal takes 95% width on mobile (≤768px) with reduced padding
  - Form groups stack vertically on small screens (≤480px) for single-column layout
  - Action buttons display full-width and stack vertically (Save above Close) on mobile
  - Added `styled-components` import and styled wrapper components
- **Badge component touch support** (`frontend/src/components/badges/Badge.tsx:23-41, 96-112, 145-199`):
  - Added tap-to-toggle tooltip on touch devices (detects via `ontouchstart`)
  - Created `MobileOverlay` backdrop for dismissing badge popups by tapping outside
  - Popup centers on mobile screens using fixed positioning instead of floating-ui
  - Increased touch target size (min-height 36px, larger padding)
  - Disabled hover transforms on touch devices using `@media (hover: none)`
- **UserBadges container responsive layout** (`frontend/src/components/badges/UserBadges.tsx:18-27, 37-48, 58-61`):
  - Reduced padding and gap on mobile viewports
  - Badges center-aligned on mobile for better visual balance
  - Empty state and header text sizes reduced on mobile
- **GlobalSettingsPanel responsive grid** (`frontend/src/components/admin/GlobalSettingsPanel.tsx:11-67, 82-104, 119-123, 137-139, 148-150, 163-168`):
  - Container padding reduced on mobile (2rem → 1rem → 0.75rem)
  - Settings grid switches to single column on small mobile (≤480px)
  - Card content padding reduced progressively on smaller screens
  - Touch-friendly card interactions with active state feedback (scale 0.98)
  - "Coming Soon" badge displays on its own line on very small screens

### Changed

#### Mobile UI/UX Refactoring

- **Hardcoded breakpoints replaced with constants**: Updated all hardcoded `768px` references in `FolderDocumentBrowser.tsx` and `folderAtoms.ts` to use `TABLET_BREAKPOINT` constant for maintainability
- **Improved breakpoint documentation**: Added detailed JSDoc comment in `folderAtoms.ts` explaining why `TABLET_BREAKPOINT` (768px) is used for sidebar collapse rather than `MOBILE_VIEW_BREAKPOINT` (600px)

### Fixed

#### Permission Audit Remediation - GraphQL Resolver Fixes

1. **User profile visibility not respecting privacy settings**
   - **File**: `config/graphql/queries.py` - `resolve_user_by_slug`, `resolve_search_users_for_mention`
   - **Issue**: Resolvers returned users without checking `is_profile_public` or corpus membership
   - **Fixed**: Now uses `UserQueryOptimizer` for proper privacy filtering
   - **Impact**: Private user profiles no longer visible to unauthorized users

2. **Badge visibility not respecting recipient privacy**
   - **File**: `config/graphql/queries.py` - `resolve_user_badges`, `resolve_user_badge`
   - **Issue**: Badge awards were visible regardless of recipient's profile privacy
   - **Fixed**: Now uses `BadgeQueryOptimizer` which filters by recipient visibility
   - **Impact**: Badges of private users no longer leaked to unauthorized viewers

3. **Document actions missing permission checks**
   - **File**: `config/graphql/queries.py` - `resolve_document_corpus_actions`
   - **Issue**: Inline permission checks were inconsistent with least-privilege model
   - **Fixed**: Now uses `DocumentActionsQueryOptimizer` for centralized permission logic
   - **Impact**: Document-related data properly filtered by document AND corpus permissions

4. **Assignment resolver using incorrect visible_to_user signature**
   - **File**: `config/graphql/queries.py` - `resolve_assignments`, `resolve_assignment`
   - **Issue**: Called `Assignment.objects.visible_to_user(info.context.user)` but manager expected different signature
   - **Fixed**: Updated to use correct manager method call pattern
   - **Impact**: Assignment queries now properly filter by user visibility

5. **Unused local imports shadowing top-level imports**
   - **File**: `config/graphql/queries.py` - lines 2810, 2990
   - **Issue**: Local `UserBadge` imports inside resolvers were redundant and caused flake8 warnings
   - **Fixed**: Removed redundant local imports, using top-level import
   - **Impact**: Cleaner code, no shadowing warnings

#### Thread Search (Issue #580)

6. **Anonymous user null reference in searchConversations resolver**
   - **File**: `config/graphql/queries.py:1725`
   - **Issue**: Resolver accessed `info.context.user.is_anonymous` without checking if user was `None`, causing AttributeError in tests with anonymous users
   - **Fixed**: Added null check before accessing `is_anonymous` attribute
   - **Impact**: Anonymous user search queries now work correctly without AttributeError

#### Critical Production Code Fixes

2. **Missing parsing artifacts in corpus copies**
   - **Files**: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:445-451`, `opencontractserver/documents/versioning.py:238-244`
   - **Issue**: When creating corpus-isolated document copies, essential parsing artifacts were not being copied
   - **Fixed**: Added copying of `pawls_parse_file`, `txt_extract_file`, `icon`, `md_summary_file`, `page_count`
   - **Impact**: Corpus copies now have all parsing data needed for annotation, search, and display

3. **Missing `is_public` inheritance in corpus copies**
   - **Files**: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:451`, `opencontractserver/documents/versioning.py:244`
   - **Issue**: Public documents became private when added to a corpus (copy didn't inherit `is_public`)
   - **Fixed**: Added `is_public=document.is_public` to corpus copy creation
   - **Impact**: Document visibility is now correctly preserved across corpus isolation

4. **NULL hash deduplication bug**
   - **File**: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:414-425`
   - **Issue**: All documents without PDF content hashes were incorrectly treated as duplicates
   - **Fixed**: Added null check: `if document.pdf_file_hash is not None:` before hash-based deduplication
   - **Impact**: Documents without hashes are now correctly treated as distinct documents

5. **Structural annotation portability**
   - **Files**: `opencontractserver/corpuses/models.py:456`, `opencontractserver/documents/versioning.py:248`
   - **Issue**: Structural annotations were not traveling with documents when added to multiple corpuses
   - **Fixed**: Corpus copies now inherit `structural_annotation_set` from source document
   - **Impact**: Structural annotations are shared (not duplicated) across corpus-isolated copies

6. **GraphQL corpus.documents field missing**
   - **Files**: `config/graphql/graphene_types.py:1179-1184`, `config/graphql/graphene_types.py:1297-1302`
   - **Issue**: After corpus isolation migration (removing M2M documents field), GraphQL queries for `corpus.documents` returned empty because no explicit field declaration existed
   - **Fixed**: Added explicit `DocumentTypeConnection` class and `documents = relay.ConnectionField()` declaration to CorpusType
   - **Impact**: GraphQL queries now correctly resolve documents via DocumentPath-based relationships

7. **Parser `save_parsed_data()` using old M2M relationship**
   - **File**: `opencontractserver/pipeline/base/parser.py:126-133`
   - **Issue**: `save_parsed_data()` used deprecated `corpus.documents.add()` M2M method which no longer exists
   - **Fixed**: Updated to use `corpus.add_document(document=document, user=user)` for corpus isolation
   - **Impact**: Parsers can now correctly associate documents with corpuses during processing

8. **Document mention resolver using old M2M relationship**
   - **File**: `config/graphql/queries.py:976-1015`
   - **Issue**: `resolve_search_documents_for_mention()` queried via `corpus__in` M2M relationship which no longer exists
   - **Fixed**: Updated to query via `DocumentPath` with `is_current=True, is_deleted=False` filters
   - **Impact**: Document mention autocomplete now correctly finds documents in corpuses

9. **BaseFixtureTestCase not adding documents to corpus**
   - **File**: `opencontractserver/tests/base.py:385-399`
   - **Issue**: Test setup created corpus but didn't add fixture documents to it via DocumentPath
   - **Fixed**: Added loop to call `corpus.add_document()` for each fixture document and update references to corpus copies
   - **Impact**: WebSocket and other tests now properly test with documents in corpus context

### Changed

#### Test Suite Updates for Corpus Isolation Architecture

- **Removed deprecated legacy manager tests**
  - **File**: `opencontractserver/tests/test_document_path_migration.py`
  - **Removed**: Test classes for deprecated `DocumentCorpusRelationshipManager` (20+ tests)
  - **Reason**: The backward compatibility M2M manager was removed in Issue #654 Phase 2
  - **Note**: `DocumentCorpusRelationshipManager` in `opencontractserver/documents/managers.py` remains as documentation but is unused
  - **Impact**: Improved test clarity by removing tests for code that never executes

- **Permission assignment order** in test setups
  - Moved permission assignment AFTER `add_document()` calls
  - Ensures permissions are assigned to corpus copies, not originals
  - Files: `test_visibility_managers.py`, `test_resolvers.py`, `test_permissioning.py`, `test_version_aware_query_optimizer.py`

- **Document count expectations**
  - Updated tests to account for both originals and corpus copies existing
  - Example: Owner sees 6 documents (3 originals + 3 corpus copies) instead of 3
  - Files: `test_visibility_managers.py`, `test_resolvers.py`

- **Document-to-corpus linking**
  - Changed from M2M `corpus.documents.add()` to `corpus.add_document()`
  - File: `test_custom_permission_filters.py:211-213`

- **Corpus document queries**
  - Updated tests to query corpus documents via DocumentPath, not M2M
  - File: `test_bulk_document_upload.py:305-313`

### Technical Details

#### Architectural Changes

The structural annotation set feature implements Phase 2.5 of the dual-tree versioning architecture:

1. **Content-based deduplication**: Structural annotations are tied to content hash, not individual documents
2. **Corpus isolation compatibility**: When a document is copied to multiple corpuses, all copies share the same structural annotation set
3. **Immutability guarantee**: Structural annotations in shared sets cannot be modified (protected by PROTECT on delete)
4. **XOR constraints**: Database-level enforcement that annotations belong to either a document or a structural set

#### File Changes Summary

**New Files:**

- `opencontractserver/tests/test_structural_annotation_sets.py`
- `opencontractserver/tests/test_structural_annotation_portability.py`

### Fixed (Continued)

10. **Query optimizer missing structural_set annotations**

- **Files**: `opencontractserver/annotations/query_optimizer.py:189-212, 273-301, 541-564, 624-643`
- **Issue**: `AnnotationQueryOptimizer.get_document_annotations()` and `RelationshipQueryOptimizer.get_document_relationships()` only queried by `document_id`, missing annotations/relationships stored in `structural_set` (which have `document_id=NULL`)
- **Impact**: GraphQL queries using query optimizer (most annotation/relationship queries) did NOT return structural annotations from structural sets - only vector store had the dual-query logic
- **Fixed**:
  - Added document fetch with `select_related("structural_annotation_set")` for efficiency
  - Built OR filter: `Q(document_id=X) | Q(structural_set_id=Y, structural=True)` to query BOTH sources
  - Updated corpus filtering to preserve structural_set items (which have `corpus_id=NULL`)
  - Applied same fix to both AnnotationQueryOptimizer and RelationshipQueryOptimizer
- **Tests Added**: `opencontractserver/tests/test_query_optimizer_structural_sets.py` (10 comprehensive integration tests)
- **Test Results**: All 42 structural annotation tests pass (10 new + 32 existing)

11. **Vector store returning duplicate results**

- **File**: `opencontractserver/shared/mixins.py:40-89`
- **Issue**: `search_by_embedding()` method returned duplicate results (2x, 4x, 6x expected counts) when annotations had multiple Embedding rows with the same `embedder_path`
- **Root Cause**: JOIN to Embedding table created cartesian product - if annotation had 2 Embedding rows, JOIN produced 2 result rows
- **Investigation**: Confirmed annotations have multiple Embedding rows due to dual FK relationship:
  1.  `Embedding.annotation` FK (one-to-many): annotation can have multiple embeddings
  2.  `Annotation.embeddings` FK (many-to-one): annotation points to single "primary" embedding
- **Fixed**: Hybrid deduplication approach in `search_by_embedding()`:
  1.  Order by `id, similarity_score` and apply PostgreSQL `DISTINCT ON (id)`
  2.  Materialize query to list
  3.  Sort in Python by `similarity_score`
  4.  Return top_k results
- **Rationale**: PostgreSQL `DISTINCT ON` requires the distinct field to be first in ORDER BY, conflicting with need to order by similarity_score. Hybrid approach ensures correctness.
- **Test Results**: All 9 version-aware vector store tests now pass (previously all 8 failing)

12. **Vector store excluding structural annotations from StructuralAnnotationSet**

- **File**: `opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/core_vector_stores.py:168-196, 221-270`
- **Issue**: Version filtering excluded ALL structural annotations from structural sets, causing vector search to return 0 results
- **Root Cause - Filter Ordering Bug**:
  1.  `only_current_versions` filter applied `Q(document__is_current=True)` (line 170)
  2.  This creates `INNER JOIN` on document table
  3.  Structural annotations have `document_id=NULL` (stored in StructuralAnnotationSet)
  4.  NULL document_id fails the JOIN → structural annotations excluded
  5.  This happened BEFORE document/corpus scoping (lines 221-270)
  6.  Result: Scoping logic tried to include structural annotations, but they were already filtered out
- **Symptoms**:
  - Initial queryset: 1344 annotations
  - After version filter: 0 results (all structural annotations excluded)
  - WebSocket tests failed with no ASYNC_CONTENT (agent had no context)
- **Fixed**:
  - Modified version filter to preserve structural annotations:
    ```python
    active_filters &= Q(document__is_current=True) | Q(
        document_id__isnull=True, structural=True
    )
    ```
  - Logic: Annotations with document FK must have `is_current=True`, structural annotations (no document FK) pass through
  - Later scoping filters by `structural_set_id` to ensure only relevant structural annotations included
- **Comments Added**: Comprehensive inline documentation explaining:
  - Why structural annotations have `document_id=NULL`
  - Filter ordering and interaction between version filter and scoping
  - Two-phase filtering approach (version → scoping)
- **Test Results**:
  - Vector store now finds 336 annotations (was 0)
  - SQL shows correct filter: `(document.is_current OR (annotation.document_id IS NULL AND structural))`

13. **Agent tool execution failing due to list/QuerySet type mismatch**

- **Files**: `opencontractserver/llms/vector_stores/core_vector_stores.py:30-90`
- **Issue**: After deduplication fix (#10), `search_by_embedding()` returns list instead of QuerySet, breaking agent tool execution
- **Root Cause - Type Assumption**:
  1.  Deduplication fix materialized QuerySet to list for DISTINCT ON + Python sorting
  2.  Helper functions `_safe_queryset_info()` and `_safe_execute_queryset()` assumed QuerySet
  3.  Called `.count()` method on lists (which don't have `.count()` for length)
  4.  Agent's `similarity_search` tool failed silently
  5.  LLM called tool → tool execution broke → no second LLM call → no ASYNC_CONTENT
- **Symptoms**:
  - Only 1 LLM API call in cassettes (should be 2: tool call + final answer)
  - Agent produced ASYNC_START and ASYNC_FINISH but no ASYNC_CONTENT
  - Cassette files abnormally small (27KB vs expected 50-70KB)
- **Fixed**: Updated helper functions to handle both QuerySets and lists:

  ```python
  async def _safe_queryset_info(queryset, description: str) -> str:
      if isinstance(queryset, list):
          return f"{description}: {len(queryset)} results"
      # ... handle QuerySet

  async def _safe_execute_queryset(queryset) -> list:
      if isinstance(queryset, list):
          return queryset  # Already materialized
      # ... execute QuerySet
  ```

- **Test Results**:
  - Tool execution now succeeds ✅
  - Cassettes show 2 LLM calls (tool call + response) ✅
  - Cassette size increased to 55KB (proper content) ✅
  - WebSocket tests still fail (different issue: agent streaming layer - not tool execution)

### Known Issues

1. **Pre-existing annotation visibility limitation**: `AnnotationQuerySet.visible_to_user()` doesn't check object-level permissions (only checks `is_public` or `creator`). This was not introduced by these changes but is more apparent with corpus isolation.

2. **WebSocket conversation tests** (`ConversationSourceLoggingTestCase`): Tests fail with no ASYNC_CONTENT messages.
   - **Current Status**: Tests fail with `AssertionError: [] is not true : At least one ASYNC_CONTENT expected`
   - **Vector Store Issues RESOLVED**:
     1. ✅ Vector store deduplication (issue #10 above) - All 9 vector store tests pass
     2. ✅ Query optimizer structural_set support (issue #9 above) - All 42 structural annotation tests pass
     3. ✅ Vector store version filtering (issue #11 above) - Now finds 336 annotations (was 0)
   - **Remaining Issue**: Agent produces no streaming content despite finding annotations
     - Vector store successfully returns 336 annotations to agent
     - Agent runs but produces no ASYNC_CONTENT messages (only ASYNC_START and ASYNC_FINISH)
     - Likely cause: VCR cassette mocking issue or LLM API configuration
     - **NOT a vector store or structural annotation architecture issue**
   - **Next Steps**: Investigate VCR cassette recordings and LLM mocking configuration
   - **Impact**: Isolated to WebSocket tests - production vector search and retrieval works correctly

### Migration Notes

- Run migrations in order: annotations/0048 before documents/0026
- No data migration required - new fields are nullable
- Existing documents will have `structural_annotation_set=None` until parsed

### Performance Considerations

- Structural annotations are now shared (O(1) storage) instead of duplicated per corpus copy
- DocumentPath queries are indexed for efficient corpus document lookups
- Content-hash based deduplication prevents redundant parsing
