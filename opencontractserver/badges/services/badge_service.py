"""Badge service — permission-aware badge queries with profile privacy filtering.

Badge visibility follows the recipient's profile visibility rules.

Visibility model for UserBadge:
- Badge awards are visible if the recipient's profile is visible
- Follows ``UserService``'s visibility rules
- Corpus-specific badges: visible to users with access to that corpus
- Own badges: always visible regardless of profile privacy

The key insight is that badge visibility derives from user profile
visibility, not from direct badge permissions.

Migrated from ``badges/query_optimizer.py`` as Phase 4 of the service-layer
centralization roadmap — see
docs/refactor_plans/2026-05-19-service-layer-centralization-design.md.
