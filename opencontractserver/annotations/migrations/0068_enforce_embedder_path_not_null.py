"""
Backfill any legacy Embedding rows with NULL ``embedder_path`` and then
tighten the column to ``NOT NULL``.

Context (issue #1357): ``Embedding.embedder_path`` was declared
``null=True, blank=True`` on the Django field while its Python annotation
claimed ``str``. The partial unique constraints added in migration 0059
reference ``embedder_path`` with ``condition=Q(<parent>__isnull=False)``,
meaning any row where ``embedder_path`` is NULL silently bypasses duplicate
prevention. Every production creation path (store_embedding, add_embedding,
worker_uploads) already supplies a concrete value, so we enforce the
invariant at the DB level to match.

Backfill strategy:
  1. For each NULL-embedder_path row, set ``embedder_path`` to
     ``settings.DEFAULT_EMBEDDER``.
  2. If that assignment would collide with an existing (embedder_path,
     parent) row under a partial unique constraint, delete the NULL row
     instead — it cannot be matched by any query (all call sites filter
     on a concrete ``embedder_path``) so it was effectively dead data.
