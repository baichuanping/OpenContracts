"""Regression tests for ``opencontractserver.llms.agents.pydantic_ai_factory``.

These tests defend the behaviour described in CLAUDE.md pitfall #14 and
issue #1451: pydantic-ai silently drops the ``system_prompt=`` argument
when ``message_history`` is non-empty (which is always the case in
OpenContracts' chat() flow), so all agent construction must funnel
through ``make_pydantic_ai_agent``, which:

1. Refuses ``system_prompt=`` outright (loud failure).
2. Honours ``instructions=`` such that the system instruction is
   actually delivered to the model when ``message_history`` is non-empty.

The second test is the version-pinning canary: if a future pydantic-ai
release changes precedence so that ``instructions=`` is also dropped (or
its delivery semantics change), this test fails loudly so the regression
is caught before silently shipping.
