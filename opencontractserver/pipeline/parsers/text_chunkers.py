"""
Pluggable text-chunking strategies for text-based parsers.

A chunker takes raw document text and emits a sequence of ``TextChunk``
objects.  Each chunk carries its character-level ``[start, end)`` span, the
raw text and the annotation-label name under which it should be stored.
Parsers convert the chunks into structural ``SPAN_LABEL`` annotations.

The strategies live behind a single abstraction so text-oriented parsers
(``TxtParser`` today, any future plain-text parser tomorrow) can select the
retrieval granularity that best matches the downstream workload — sentences
for fine-grained UI interactions, paragraphs or fixed character windows for
RAG retrieval.

Strategies are looked up by name via :func:`get_chunker`.  Adding a new
strategy is a two-line change (class definition + ``register_chunker``
decorator). ``SentenceChunker`` additionally requires the optional
``spacy`` dependency.

Example::

    from opencontractserver.pipeline.parsers.text_chunkers import get_chunker

    chunker = get_chunker({"name": "sliding_window", "window_size": 1200})
    for chunk in chunker.chunk(text):
        ...

    Produces chunks of approximately ``window_size`` characters with

    the LangChain-style recipe that is common in RAG benchmarks.

    Parameters:
        window_size: Target chunk length in characters. Must be positive.
        overlap: Number of characters shared between consecutive chunks.
            Must be non-negative and strictly less than ``window_size``.

            neighbours may be smaller than ``overlap`` when a long word

    The window is measured in *characters*, not tokens. Callers sizing
